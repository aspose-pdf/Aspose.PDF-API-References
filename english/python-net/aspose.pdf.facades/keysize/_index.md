| :- | :- |
|X40|40 bit key. Such key size is used with RC4 algorithm and provides low level of security. <br/>            Nevertheless old versions of pdf documents can be encrypted only with such keys (v. 1.3 and lower);|
|X128|128 bit key. Both RC4 and AES algorithms can use such key size.|
|X256|256 bit key. Such key size can be used only with AES and is recognized with the last Adobe Reader versions (starting from v.9).|
