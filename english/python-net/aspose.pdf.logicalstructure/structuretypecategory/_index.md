## StructureTypeCategory class

Represents Categories of Standard Structure Types.

The StructureTypeCategory type exposes the following members:
## Properties
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
|GROUPING_ELEMENTS|Grouping elements group other elements into sequences or hierarchies but hold no content directly and have no direct effect on layout.|
|BLS_ES|Block-level structure elements (BLSEs) describe the overall layout of content on the page, proceeding in the block-progression direction.|
|ILS_ES|Inline-level structure elements (ILSEs) describe the layout of content within a BLSE, proceeding in the inline-progression direction.|
|ILLUSTRATION_ELEMENTS|Illustration elements are compact sequences of content, in page content order, that are considered to be unitary objects with respect to page layout. An illustration can be treated as either a BLSE or an ILSE.|
