## IIndexBitmapConverter class

This interface declared for customization algorithms of quantization. <br/>            Users can implement their own realization of this algorithms (for example algorithms based on unmanaged code).

The IIndexBitmapConverter type exposes the following members:
## Methods
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
|get_1_bpp_image(src)|Returns 1Bpp bitmap representation|
|get_4_bpp_image(src)|Returns 4Bpp bitmap representation|
|get_8_bpp_image(src)|Returns 8Bpp bitmap representation|
