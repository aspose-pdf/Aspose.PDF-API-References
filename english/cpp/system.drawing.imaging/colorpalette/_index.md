## ColorPalette class


Represents a set of 32-bit ARGB colors that make up a color palette. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class ColorPalette : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| [get_Flags](./get_flags/)() const | Returns a value that specifies how the color values in the array of colors should be interpreted. |
