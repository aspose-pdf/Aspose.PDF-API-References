## ColorMap class


Represents a map for converting colors. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class ColorMap : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_NewColor](./get_newcolor/)() const | Returns the new [Color](../../system.drawing/color/) object representing the color to which to convert. |
| [get_OldColor](./get_oldcolor/)() const | Returns the old [Color](../../system.drawing/color/) object representing the color to be converted. |
| [set_NewColor](./set_newcolor/)(const Color\&) | Sets the new [Color](../../system.drawing/color/) object representing the color to which to convert. |
| [set_OldColor](./set_oldcolor/)(const Color\&) | Sets the old [Color](../../system.drawing/color/) object representing the color to be converted. |
