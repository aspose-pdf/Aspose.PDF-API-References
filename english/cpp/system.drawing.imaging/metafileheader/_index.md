## MetafileHeader class


Contains attributes associated with a graphic metafile. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class MetafileHeader : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_Bounds](./get_bounds/)() const | Returns a bounding rectangle of a metafile associated with the current object. |
| [get_DpiX](./get_dpix/)() const | NOT IMPLEMENTED. |
| [get_DpiY](./get_dpiy/)() const | NOT IMPLEMENTED. |
| [set_Bounds](./set_bounds/)(const Rectangle\&) | Sets a bounding rectangle of a metafile associated with the current object. |
