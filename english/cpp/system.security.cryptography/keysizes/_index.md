Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into System::SmartPtr pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument in C++.'

## KeySizes class


Set of key sizes accepted by symmetric algorithms. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class KeySizes : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_MaxSize](./get_maxsize/)() const | Gets maximal valid key size. |
| [get_MinSize](./get_minsize/)() const | Gets minimal valid key size. |
| [get_SkipSize](./get_skipsize/)() const | Gets valid key size step. |
| [KeySizes](./keysizes/)(int, int, int) | RTTI information. |
