## SHA256Managed class


Managed [SHA256](../sha256/) hasher. Not implemented. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class SHA256Managed : public System::Security::Cryptography::SHA256
