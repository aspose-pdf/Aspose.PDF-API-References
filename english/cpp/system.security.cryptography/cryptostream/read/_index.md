## CryptoStream::Read(const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\&, int32_t, int32_t) method


Reads data from stream.

```cpp
int32_t System::Security::Cryptography::CryptoStream::Read(const ArrayPtr<uint8_t> &buffer, int32_t offset, int32_t count) override
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\& | Destination data buffer. |
| offset | int32_t | Offset in destination buffer. |
| count | int32_t | Number of bytes to read. |

### ReturnValue

Number of bytes being read actually.
