## SHA1 class


Computes [SHA1](./) hash for input data. In C++ [SHA1](./) is not an abstract class. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class SHA1 : public System::Security::Cryptography::HashAlgorithm
```

## Methods
