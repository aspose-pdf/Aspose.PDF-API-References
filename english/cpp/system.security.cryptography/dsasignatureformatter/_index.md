Always wrap this class into System::SmartPtr pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument in C++.'

## DSASignatureFormatter class


Used to create a [DSA](../dsa/) signature. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class DSASignatureFormatter : public System::Security::Cryptography::AsymmetricSignatureFormatter
```
