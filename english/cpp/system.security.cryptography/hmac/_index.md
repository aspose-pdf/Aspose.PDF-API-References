## HMAC class


All implementations of Hash-based Message [Authentication](../../system.security.authentication/) Code ([HMAC](./)) must inherit this abstract class. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class HMAC : public System::Security::Cryptography::HashAlgorithm
```
