## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Control](./control/) | Dummy class to make translated code that uses [Control](./control/) class compilable. Methods are not implemented. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [Form](./form/) | Dummy class to make translated code that uses [Form](./form/) class compilable. Methods are not implemented. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [IButtonControl](./ibuttoncontrol/) | Dummy class to make translated code that uses [IButtonControl](./ibuttoncontrol/) interface compilable. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [Screen](./screen/) | Provides information on displays. [Windows](../system.windows/) only. This is a singleton type with memory management done by access function(s). You should never create instances of it directly. |
## Enums

| Enum | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Appearance](./appearance/) | Defines how the control looks. |
| [AutoSizeMode](./autosizemode/) | Defines how autosize works. |
| [CheckState](./checkstate/) | State of checkable control (e. g. checkbox). |
| [DialogResult](./dialogresult/) | Result of dialog interaction with user. |
| [FlatStyle](./flatstyle/) | Defines whether the control is drawn flat or three-dimentional. |
| [FormBorderStyle](./formborderstyle/) | Defines how the border is drawn. |
| [Keys](./keys/) | Known keys. |
