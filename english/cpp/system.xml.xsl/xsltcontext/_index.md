## XsltContext class


Encapsulates the current execution context of the Extensible Stylesheet Language for Transformations (XSLT) processor allowing XML Path Language ([XPath](../../system.xml.xpath/)) to resolve functions, parameters, and namespaces within [XPath](../../system.xml.xpath/) expressions.

```cpp
class XsltContext : public System::Xml::XmlNamespaceManager
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| virtual [CompareDocument](./comparedocument/)(String, String) | When overridden in a derived class, compares the base Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of two documents based upon the order the documents were loaded by the XSLT processor (that is, the [XslTransform](../xsltransform/) class). |
| virtual [get_Whitespace](./get_whitespace/)() | When overridden in a derived class, gets a value indicating whether to include white space nodes in the output. |
| virtual [PreserveWhitespace](./preservewhitespace/)(SharedPtr\<System::Xml::XPath::XPathNavigator\>) | When overridden in a derived class, evaluates whether to preserve white space nodes or strip them for the given context. |
| virtual [ResolveFunction](./resolvefunction/)(String, String, ArrayPtr\<System::Xml::XPath::XPathResultType\>) | When overridden in a derived class, resolves a function reference and returns an [IXsltContextFunction](../ixsltcontextfunction/) representing the function. The [IXsltContextFunction](../ixsltcontextfunction/) is used at execution time to get the return value of the function. |
| virtual [ResolveVariable](./resolvevariable/)(String, String) | When overridden in a derived class, resolves a variable reference and returns an [IXsltContextVariable](../ixsltcontextvariable/) representing the variable. |
## Typedefs

| Typedef | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Ptr](./ptr/) | An alias for shared pointer to an instance of this class. |
