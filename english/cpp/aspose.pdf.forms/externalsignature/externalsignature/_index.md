## ExternalSignature::ExternalSignature(System::SharedPtr\<System::Security::Cryptography::X509Certificates::X509Certificate2\>) constructor


Creates a detached PKCS#7 **(detached)** signature using a X509Certificate2. It supports usb smartcards, tokens without exportable private keys.

```cpp
Aspose::Pdf::Forms::ExternalSignature::ExternalSignature(System::SharedPtr<System::Security::Cryptography::X509Certificates::X509Certificate2> certificate)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| certificate | System::SharedPtr\<System::Security::Cryptography::X509Certificates::X509Certificate2\> | The certificate with the private key. |
## Remarks



The digest algorithm will be automatically selected based on the certificate key data.

## ExternalSignature::ExternalSignature(System::SharedPtr\<System::Security::Cryptography::X509Certificates::X509Certificate2\>, bool) constructor


Creates a detached PKCS#7 signature using a X509Certificate2. It supports usb smartcards, tokens without exportable private keys.

```cpp
Aspose::Pdf::Forms::ExternalSignature::ExternalSignature(System::SharedPtr<System::Security::Cryptography::X509Certificates::X509Certificate2> certificate, bool detached)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| certificate | System::SharedPtr\<System::Security::Cryptography::X509Certificates::X509Certificate2\> | The certificate with the private key. |
| detached | bool | True if the signature should be detached, otherwise false. |
## Remarks



For detached set to false the digest algorithm will always be **SHA1**. Otherwise, the digest algorithm will be automatically selected based on the certificate key data( see [DigestHashAlgorithm::Auto](../../../aspose.pdf/digesthashalgorithm/) ).

## ExternalSignature::ExternalSignature(System::String, bool) constructor


Creates a PKCS#7 signature using a X509Certificate2 as base64 string.

```cpp
Aspose::Pdf::Forms::ExternalSignature::ExternalSignature(System::String base64, bool detached)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| base64 | System::String | X509Certificate2 as base64 string. |
| detached | bool | True if the signature should be detached, otherwise false. |
## Remarks



For detached set to false the digest algorithm will always be **SHA1**. Otherwise, the digest algorithm will be automatically selected based on the certificate key data( see [DigestHashAlgorithm::Auto](../../../aspose.pdf/digesthashalgorithm/) ).
