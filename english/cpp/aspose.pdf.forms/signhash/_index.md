## SignHash typedef


Delegate for custom sign the document hash.

```cpp
using Aspose::Pdf::Forms::SignHash =  System::MulticastDelegate<System::ArrayPtr<uint8_t>(System::ArrayPtr<uint8_t>, Aspose::Pdf::DigestHashAlgorithm)>
```

## Remarks



[Note](../../aspose.pdf/note/) that whether the digital signature is detached or not, the hash argument will always be the final hash to be signed.
