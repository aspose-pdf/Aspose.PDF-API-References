## SignDependentElementsRenderingModeWhenConverted field


[Forms](../../) can contain signing information, i.e. can be signed or unsigned. And form's view sometimes must depend on whether form is signed or not. This property tells to form's converter (f.e. during conversion [XFA](../../xfa/) form to Standard form) whether result form must be rendered as signed or as unsigned.

```cpp
Form::SignDependentElementsRenderingModes Aspose::Pdf::Forms::Form::SignDependentElementsRenderingModeWhenConverted
