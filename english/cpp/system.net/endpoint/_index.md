## EndPoint class


The abstract class contains a network address. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class EndPoint : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |

| virtual [get_AddressFamily](./get_addressfamily/)() | RTTI information. |
| virtual [GetImpl](./getimpl/)() const | Returns a pointer to implementation. |
## Typedefs

| Typedef | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ImplPtr](./implptr/) | A pointer to implementation. |
