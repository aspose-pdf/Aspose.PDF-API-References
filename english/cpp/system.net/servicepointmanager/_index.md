## ServicePointManager class


Manages the lifecycle stages (creating, maintaining, and deleting) of the [ServicePoint](../servicepoint/) class instances. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class ServicePointManager : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [get_CertificatePolicy](./get_certificatepolicy/)() | Gets a certificate policy. |
| static [get_CheckCertificateRevocationList](./get_checkcertificaterevocationlist/)() | Gets a value that indicates if the certificate must be checked against the certificate authority revocation list. |
| static [get_DefaultConnectionLimit](./get_defaultconnectionlimit/)() | Gets the maximum number of concurrent connections that are allowed by the ServicePoint-class instances. |
