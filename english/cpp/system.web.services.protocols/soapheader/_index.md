## SoapHeader class


Represents content of the SOAP header. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class SoapHeader : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_Actor](./get_actor/)() | Gets the URI of the SOAP header recipient when SOAP version 1.1 is used. |
| [get_DidUnderstand](./get_didunderstand/)() | Gets a value that indicates if the SOAP header is properly processed. |
| [get_EncodedMustUnderstand](./get_encodedmustunderstand/)() | Gets a value of the 'mustUnderstand' attribute when SOAP version 1.1 is used. |
| [get_EncodedMustUnderstand12](./get_encodedmustunderstand12/)() | Gets a value of the 'mustUnderstand' attribute when SOAP version 1.2 is used. |
| [get_EncodedRelay](./get_encodedrelay/)() | Gets a string representation of the 'relay' attribute value. |
| [get_MustUnderstand](./get_mustunderstand/)() | Gets a value that indicates if the SOAP header must be understood. |
