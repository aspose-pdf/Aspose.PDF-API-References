## SoapHttpClientProtocol class


The client proxy services must inherit this class when the SOAP is used. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class SoapHttpClientProtocol : public System::Web::Services::Protocols::HttpWebClientProtocol
```
