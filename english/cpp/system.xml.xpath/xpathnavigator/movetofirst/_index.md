## XPathNavigator::MoveToFirst method


Moves the [XPathNavigator](../) to the first sibling node of the current node.

```cpp
virtual bool System::Xml::XPath::XPathNavigator::MoveToFirst()
```


### ReturnValue

**true** if the [XPathNavigator](../) is successful moving to the first sibling node of the current node; **false** if there is no first sibling, or if the [XPathNavigator](../) is currently positioned on an attribute node. If the [XPathNavigator](../) is already positioned on the first sibling, [XPathNavigator](../) will return **true** and will not move its position. If [XPathNavigator::MoveToFirst](./) returns **false** because there is no first sibling, or if [XPathNavigator](../) is currently positioned on an attribute, the position of the [XPathNavigator](../) is unchanged.
