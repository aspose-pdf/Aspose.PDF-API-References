When overridden in a derived class, determines whether the current [XPathNavigator](../) is at the same position as the specified [XPathNavigator](../).

```cpp
virtual bool System::Xml::XPath::XPathNavigator::IsSamePosition(SharedPtr<XPathNavigator> other)=0
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | SharedPtr\<XPathNavigator\> | The [XPathNavigator](../) to compare to this [XPathNavigator](../). |
