## XPathNavigator::MoveToPrevious method


When overridden in a derived class, moves the [XPathNavigator](../) to the previous sibling node of the current node.

```cpp
virtual bool System::Xml::XPath::XPathNavigator::MoveToPrevious()=0
```


### ReturnValue

**true** if the [XPathNavigator](../) is successful moving to the previous sibling node; otherwise, **false** if there is no previous sibling node or if the [XPathNavigator](../) is currently positioned on an attribute node. If **false**, the position of the [XPathNavigator](../) is unchanged.
