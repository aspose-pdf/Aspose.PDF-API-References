## XPathNavigator::MoveToNext() method


When overridden in a derived class, moves the [XPathNavigator](../) to the next sibling node of the current node.

```cpp
virtual bool System::Xml::XPath::XPathNavigator::MoveToNext()=0
```


### ReturnValue

**true** if the [XPathNavigator](../) is successful moving to the next sibling node; otherwise **false** if there are no more siblings or if the [XPathNavigator](../) is currently positioned on an attribute node. If **false**, the position of the [XPathNavigator](../) is unchanged.

## XPathNavigator::MoveToNext(String, String) method


Moves the [XPathNavigator](../) to the next sibling node with the local name and namespace URI specified.

```cpp
virtual bool System::Xml::XPath::XPathNavigator::MoveToNext(String localName, String namespaceURI)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| localName | String | The local name of the next sibling node to move to. |
| namespaceURI | String | The namespace URI of the next sibling node to move to. |

### ReturnValue

**true** if the [XPathNavigator](../) is successful moving to the next sibling node; **false** if there are no more siblings, or if the [XPathNavigator](../) is currently positioned on an attribute node. If **false**, the position of the [XPathNavigator](../) is unchanged.

## XPathNavigator::MoveToNext(XPathNodeType) method


Moves the [XPathNavigator](../) to the next sibling node of the current node that matches the XPathNodeType specified.

```cpp
virtual bool System::Xml::XPath::XPathNavigator::MoveToNext(XPathNodeType type)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | XPathNodeType | The XPathNodeType of the sibling node to move to. |

### ReturnValue

**true** if the [XPathNavigator](../) is successful moving to the next sibling node; otherwise, **false** if there are no more siblings or if the [XPathNavigator](../) is currently positioned on an attribute node. If **false**, the position of the [XPathNavigator](../) is unchanged.
