## XPathNodeIterator::get_Current method


When overridden in a derived class, gets the [XPathNavigator](../../xpathnavigator/) object for this [XPathNodeIterator](../), positioned on the current context node.

```cpp
virtual const SharedPtr<XPathNavigator> & System::Xml::XPath::XPathNodeIterator::get_Current()=0
```


### ReturnValue

An [XPathNavigator](../../xpathnavigator/) object positioned on the context node from which the node set was selected. The [XPathNodeIterator::MoveNext](../movenext/) method must be called to move the [XPathNodeIterator](../) to the first node in the selected set.
