## XPathNodeIterator::MoveNext method


When overridden in a derived class, moves the [XPathNavigator](../../xpathnavigator/) object returned by the [XPathNodeIterator::get_Current](../get_current/) method to the next node in the selected node set.

```cpp
virtual bool System::Xml::XPath::XPathNodeIterator::MoveNext()=0
```


### ReturnValue

**true** if the [XPathNavigator](../../xpathnavigator/) object moved to the next node; **false** if there are no more selected nodes.
