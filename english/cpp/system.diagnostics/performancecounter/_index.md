## PerformanceCounter class


Dummy class for PerformanceCounter-using translated code to compile. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class PerformanceCounter : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Close](./close/)() | Stops all performance counting operations. |
| [NextValue](./nextvalue/)() | Gets next measured value. |
| [PerformanceCounter](./performancecounter/)() | Creates performance counter. |
| [PerformanceCounter](./performancecounter/)(const String\&, const String\&) | Creates performance counter of specific category. |
| [PerformanceCounter](./performancecounter/)(const String\&, const String\&, const String\&, const String\&) | Creates performance counter of specific category and instance name. |
