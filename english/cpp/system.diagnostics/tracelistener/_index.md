## TraceListener class


Interface to react to debug and trace infofmation. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class TraceListener : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| virtual [Fail](./fail/)(System::String) | Writes failure message to debugger. |
| virtual [Fail](./fail/)(System::String, System::String) | Writes failure message to debugger. |
| virtual [Write](./write/)(System::String) | RTTI information. |
| virtual [WriteLine](./writeline/)(System::String) | Writes line to debugger. |
