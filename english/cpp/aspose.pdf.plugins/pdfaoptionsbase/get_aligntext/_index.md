## PdfAOptionsBase::get_AlignText method


Gets a value indicating whether additional means are necessary to preserve text alignment during the PDF/A conversion process.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Pdf::Plugins::PdfAOptionsBase::get_AlignText()
```

## Remarks


**true**

if the text alignment gets changed and additional actions are necessary to restore it; otherwise, **false**

. 

When set to **true**

, the conversion process will attempt to restore the original text segment bounds. For the most of the documents there is no need to change this property from the default **false**

value, as the text alignment doesn't change during the default conversion process.
