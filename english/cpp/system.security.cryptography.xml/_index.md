Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [KeyInfo](./keyinfo/) | Represents the [KeyInfo](./keyinfo/) element of an XML digital signature or an XML encryption. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function.

Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [Reference](./reference/) | Facilitates creation of the XML signatures. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [RSAKeyValue](./rsakeyvalue/) | Represents the '[RSAKeyValue](./rsakeyvalue/)' element of the XML signature. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [SignedInfo](./signedinfo/) | Represents the '[SignedInfo](./signedinfo/)' element of the XML signature. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [SignedXml](./signedxml/) | Used for XML signing and verification. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function.
