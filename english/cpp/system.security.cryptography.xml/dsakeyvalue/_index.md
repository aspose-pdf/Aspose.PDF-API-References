## DSAKeyValue class


Represents the [DSA](../../system.security.cryptography/dsa/) private key. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class DSAKeyValue : public System::Security::Cryptography::Xml::KeyInfoClause
```
