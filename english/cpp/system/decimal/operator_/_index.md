## Decimal::operator* method


Returns a new instance of [Decimal](../) class that represents a value that is a result of multiplication of values represented by the current and specified objects.

```cpp
Decimal System::Decimal::operator*(const Decimal &d) const
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d | const Decimal\& | The [Decimal](../) object representing the multiplier |

### ReturnValue

A new instance of [Decimal](../) class that represents a value that is a result of multiplication of values represented by the current and specified objects

## Decimal::operator< method


Determines if the value represented by the current object is less than the value represented by the specified object.

```cpp
bool System::Decimal::operator<(const Decimal &d) const
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d | const Decimal\& | The [Decimal](../) object to compare the current object with |

### ReturnValue

True if the value represented by the current object is less than the value represented by **d**, otherwise - false
