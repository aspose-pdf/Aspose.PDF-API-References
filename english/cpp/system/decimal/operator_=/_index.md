## Decimal::operator*= method


Assigns to the current object a new value that is the result of multiplication of values represented by the current and specified objects.

```cpp
Decimal & System::Decimal::operator*=(const Decimal &d)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d | const Decimal\& | The [Decimal](../) object representing the multiplier |

### ReturnValue

A reference to the self

## Decimal::operator<= method


Determines if the value represented by the current object is less than or equal to the value represented by the specified object.

```cpp
bool System::Decimal::operator<=(const Decimal &d) const
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d | const Decimal\& | The [Decimal](../) object to compare the current object with |

### ReturnValue

True if the value represented by the current object is less than or equal to the value represented by **d**, otherwise - false
