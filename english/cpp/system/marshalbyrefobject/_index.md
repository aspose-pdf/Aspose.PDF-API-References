## MarshalByRefObject class


Provides access to objects across application domain boundaries in remoting-enabled applications. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class MarshalByRefObject : public virtual System::Object
```
