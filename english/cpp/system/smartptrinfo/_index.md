## SmartPtrInfo class


Service class to test and alter [SmartPtr](../smartptr/)'s contents without knowing final type. Used for garbage collection and loop references detection, etc. Think of it as of 'pointer to pointer'. We can't use [SmartPtr](../smartptr/)'s basetype as it doesn't have any; instead, we use this 'info' class.

```cpp
class SmartPtrInfo
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [getInternalPtr](./getinternalptr/)() const | Gets raw object referenced pointer points to. |
| [getObject](./getobject/)() const | Gets object referenced pointer points to. |
| [getOwned](./getowned/)() const | Gets object owned pointer. |
| [operator bool](./operatorbool/)() const | Checks if info object points to non-null pointer. |
| [operator!](./operator!/)() const | Checks if info object does not point to non-null pointer. |
| [operator->](./operator-_/)() const | Allows to call methods of [Object](../object/) pointed by the referenced pointer. |
| [operator<](./operator_/)(const SmartPtrInfo\&) const | Less-compares values of pointers referenced by two info objects. |
| [SmartPtrInfo](./smartptrinfo/)() | Creates empty [SmartPtrInfo](./) object. |
| explicit [SmartPtrInfo](./smartptrinfo/)(const SmartPtr\<T\>\&) | Creates [SmartPtrInfo](./) object with information on specific smart pointer. |
