## DynamicWeakPtr class


Smart pointer class which tracks pointer modes of template arguments of stored object and updates them after each assignment. This type is a pointer to manage other object's deletion. It should be allocated on stack and passed to functions either by value or by const reference.

```cpp
template<typename T,SmartPtrMode,unsigned int ...>class DynamicWeakPtr : public System::SmartPtr<T>
```


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pointee | type. |
| trunkMode | Mode of smart pointer itself, shared or weak. |
| weakLeafs | Indexes of template arguments of stored type which should be set to weak pointer mode. |

| [DynamicWeakPtr](./dynamicweakptr/)(std::nullptr_t) | Creates null smart pointer. |
| [DynamicWeakPtr](./dynamicweakptr/)(Pointee_ *) | Creates smart pointer pointing to given object. |
| [DynamicWeakPtr](./dynamicweakptr/)(const SmartPtr_\&) | Copy-constructs smart pointer. |
| [DynamicWeakPtr](./dynamicweakptr/)(const SmartPtr\<Q\>\&) | Copy-constructs smart pointer. |
| [DynamicWeakPtr](./dynamicweakptr/)(const DynamicWeakPtr_\&) | Copy-constructs smart pointer. |
| [DynamicWeakPtr](./dynamicweakptr/)(SmartPtr_\&&) | Move-constructs smart pointer. |
| [operator=](./operator=/)(SmartPtr_\&&) | Move-assigns smart pointer. |
| [operator=](./operator=/)(const SmartPtr_\&) | Copy-assigns smart pointer. |
| [operator=](./operator=/)(const SmartPtr\<Q\>\&) | Copy-assigns smart pointer. |
| [operator=](./operator=/)(typename SmartPtr_::Pointee_ *) | Assigns smart pointer. |
| [operator=](./operator=/)(std::nullptr_t) | Sets smart pointer to null. |
| [operator==](./operator==/)(std::nullptr_t) const | Checks if smart pointer is null. |
