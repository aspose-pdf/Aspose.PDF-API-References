## ValueType class


Baseclass for value types with [Object](../object/) inheritance being truncated for performance reasons. This type should be allocated on stack and passed to functions by value or by reference. Never use [System::SmartPtr](../smartptr/) class to manage objects of this type.

```cpp
class ValueType
```
