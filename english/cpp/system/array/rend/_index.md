## Array::rend() const method


Returns a reverse iterator to the element following the last element of the reversed container. It corresponds to the element preceding the first element of the non-reversed container. This element acts as a placeholder, attempting to access it results in undefined behavior.

```cpp
const_reverse_iterator System::Array<T>::rend() const noexcept
```


### ReturnValue

An iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element of the const-qualified container.

* Typedef [const_reverse_iterator](../const_reverse_iterator/)
* Class [Array](../)
