## TimeSpan::TimeSpan(int, int, int, int, int) constructor


Constructs an instance of [TimeSpan](../) class that represents the time interval which is equal to the sum of the specified number of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.

```cpp
System::TimeSpan::TimeSpan(int days, int hours, int minutes, int seconds, int milliseconds=0)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| days | int | The number of days in the days component of the time interval to be represented by the instance being constructed |
| hours | int | The number of hours in the hours component of the time interval to be represented by the instance being constructed |
| minutes | int | The number of minutes in the minutes component of the time interval to be represented by the instance being constructed |
| seconds | int | The number of seconds in the seconds component of the time interval to be represented by the instance being constructed |
| milliseconds | int | The number of milliseconds in the milliseconds component of the time interval to be represented by the instance being constructed |

## TimeSpan::TimeSpan(int64_t) constructor


Constructs an instance of [TimeSpan](../) class that represents the specified time interval.

```cpp
System::TimeSpan::TimeSpan(int64_t ticks)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ticks | int64_t | The time interval to be represented by the instance being constructed expressed as the number of 100-nanoseconds intervals. |
