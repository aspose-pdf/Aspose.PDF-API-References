## SmartPtr class


Pointer class to wrap types being allocated on heap. Use it to manage memory for classes inheriting [Object](../object/). This pointer type follows intrusive pointer semantics. Reference counter is stored either in [Object](../object/) itself or in counter structure which is tied to [Object](../object/) instance tightly. In any case, all [SmartPtr](./) instances form single ownership group regardless how they were created which is unlike how std::shared_ptr class behaves. Converting raw pointer to [SmartPtr](./) is safe given there are other [SmartPtr](./) instances holding shared references to the same object. [SmartPtr](./) class instance can be in one of two states: shared pointer and weak pointer. To keep object alive, one should have count of shared references to it positive. Both weak and shared pointers can be used to access pointed object (to call methods, read or write fields, etc.), but weak pointers do not participate to shared pointer reference counting. [Object](../object/) is being deleted when the last 'shared' [SmartPtr](./) pointer to it is being destroyed. So, make sure that this doesn't happen when no other shared [SmartPtr](./) pointers to object exist, e. g. during object construction or destruction. Use System::Object::ThisProtector sentry objects (in C++ code) or CppCTORSelfReference or CppSelfReference attribute (in C# code being translated) to fix this issue. Similarily, make sure to break loop references by using [System::WeakPtr](../weakptr/) pointer class or [System::SmartPtrMode::Weak](../smartptrmode/) pointer mode (in C++ code) or CppWeakPtr attribute (in C# code being translated). If two or more objects reference each other using 'shared' pointers, they will never be deleted. If pointer type (weak or shared) should be switched in runtime, use [System::SmartPtr<T>::set_Mode()](./set_mode/) method or [System::DynamicWeakPtr](../dynamicweakptr/) class. [SmartPtr](./) class doesn't contain any virtual methods. You should only inherit it if you're creating a memory management strategy of your own. This type is a pointer to manage other object's deletion. It should be allocated on stack and passed to functions either by value or by const reference.
