## PrinterResolution class


Represents a resolution of a printer. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class PrinterResolution : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_X](./get_x/)() const | Returns horizontal resolution. |
| [get_Y](./get_y/)() const | Returns vertical resolution. |
| [set_X](./set_x/)(int) | Sets horizontal resolution. |
| [set_Y](./set_y/)(int) | Sets vertical resolution. |
