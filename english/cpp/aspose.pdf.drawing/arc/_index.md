```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Arc](./arc/)(float, float, float, float, float) | Initializes a new instance of the [Arc](./) class. |
| [CheckBounds](./checkbounds/)(double, double) override | Checks if the item fits within the given container dimensions (inclusive). |
| [get_Alpha](./get_alpha/)() const | Gets a float value that indicates the beginning angle degree of the arc. |
| [get_Beta](./get_beta/)() const | Gets a float value that indicates the ending angle degree of the arc. |
| [get_PosX](./get_posx/)() const | Gets a float value that indicates the x-coordinate of the center of the arc. |
| [get_PosY](./get_posy/)() const | Gets a float value that indicates the y-coordinate of the center of the arc. |
| [get_Radius](./get_radius/)() const | Gets a float value that indicates the radius of the arc. |
| [set_Alpha](./set_alpha/)(double) | Sets a float value that indicates the beginning angle degree of the arc. |
| [set_Beta](./set_beta/)(double) | Sets a float value that indicates the ending angle degree of the arc. |
| [set_PosX](./set_posx/)(double) | Sets a float value that indicates the x-coordinate of the center of the arc. |
| [set_PosY](./set_posy/)(double) | Sets a float value that indicates the y-coordinate of the center of the arc. |
| [set_Radius](./set_radius/)(double) | Sets a float value that indicates the radius of the arc. |
