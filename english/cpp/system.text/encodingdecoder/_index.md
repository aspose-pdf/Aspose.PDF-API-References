## EncodingDecoder class


[Decoder](../decoder/) that uses encoding object for decoding. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class EncodingDecoder : public System::Text::Decoder
```
