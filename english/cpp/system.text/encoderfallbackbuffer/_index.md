## EncoderFallbackBuffer class


Provides buffer for fallback implementation. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class EncoderFallbackBuffer : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| virtual [Fallback](./fallback/)(char_t, char_t, int) | Implements actual fallback procedure. |
| virtual [get_Remaining](./get_remaining/)() const | Gets remaining count of characters to be processed. |
| virtual [GetNextChar](./getnextchar/)() | Extracts next character in fallback buffer. |
| virtual [MovePrevious](./moveprevious/)() | Moves buffer position one step back if possible. |
| virtual [Reset](./reset/)() | Resets buffer to initial state. |
