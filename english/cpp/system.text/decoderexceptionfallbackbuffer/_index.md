Objects of this class should only be allocated using System::MakeObject() function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into System::SmartPtr pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument in C++.'

## DecoderExceptionFallbackBuffer class


[Buffer](../../system/buffer/) for exception-throwing decoding fallback strategy. Doesn't store anything actually, but throws instead. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class DecoderExceptionFallbackBuffer : public System::Text::DecoderFallbackBuffer
```
