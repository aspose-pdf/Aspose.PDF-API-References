## MethodBase class


Base information on method. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class MethodBase : public System::Reflection::MemberInfo
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_MemberType](./get_membertype/)() const override | Indicating the type of the member - method, constructor, event, and so on. |
| static [GetCurrentMethod](./getcurrentmethod/)(const String\&) | This method allows getting current method name. Translator substitutes ASPOSE_CURRENT_FUNCTION as parameter automatically. |
| [MEMBER_FUNCTION_MAKE_OBJECT](./member_function_make_object/)(MethodBase, CODEPORTING_ARGS(const String\&full_name), CODEPORTING_ARGS(full_name)) |  |
| [MethodBase](./methodbase/)() | Initializes a new instance of the [MethodBase](./) class. |
