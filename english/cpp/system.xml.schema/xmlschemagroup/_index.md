## XmlSchemaGroup class


Represents the **group** element from XML [Schema](../) as specified by the World Wide [Web](../../system.web/) Consortium (W3C). This class defines groups at the **schema** level that are referenced from the complex types. It groups a set of element declarations so that they can be incorporated as a group into complex type definitions.

```cpp
class XmlSchemaGroup : public System::Xml::Schema::XmlSchemaAnnotated
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_Name](./get_name/)() | Returns the name of the schema group. |
| [get_Particle](./get_particle/)() | Returns one of the [XmlSchemaChoice](../xmlschemachoice/), [XmlSchemaAll](../xmlschemaall/), or [XmlSchemaSequence](../xmlschemasequence/) classes. |
| [get_QualifiedName](./get_qualifiedname/)() | Returns the qualified name of the schema group. |
| [set_Name](./set_name/)(const String\&) | Sets the name of the schema group. |
| [set_Particle](./set_particle/)(const SharedPtr\<XmlSchemaGroupBase\>\&) | Sets one of the [XmlSchemaChoice](../xmlschemachoice/), [XmlSchemaAll](../xmlschemaall/), or [XmlSchemaSequence](../xmlschemasequence/) classes. |
| [XmlSchemaGroup](./xmlschemagroup/)() | Initializes a new instance of the [XmlSchemaGroup](./) class. |
## Typedefs

| Typedef | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Ptr](./ptr/) | An alias for shared pointer to an instance of this class. |
## Remarks



Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instances of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.
