## Remarks



Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instances of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.
