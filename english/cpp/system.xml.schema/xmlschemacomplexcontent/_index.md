## XmlSchemaComplexContent class


Represents the **complexContent** element from XML [Schema](../) as specified by the World Wide [Web](../../system.web/) Consortium (W3C). This class represents the complex content model for complex types. It contains extensions or restrictions on a complex type that has either only elements or mixed content.

```cpp
class XmlSchemaComplexContent : public System::Xml::Schema::XmlSchemaContentModel
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_Content](./get_content/)() override | Returns the content. |
| [get_IsMixed](./get_ismixed/)() | Returns information that determines if the type has a mixed content model. |
| [set_Content](./set_content/)(SharedPtr\<XmlSchemaContent\>) override | Sets the content. |
| [set_IsMixed](./set_ismixed/)(bool) | Sets information that determines if the type has a mixed content model. |
| [XmlSchemaComplexContent](./xmlschemacomplexcontent/)() | Initializes a new instance of the [XmlSchemaComplexContent](./) class. |
## Typedefs

| Typedef | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Ptr](./ptr/) | An alias for shared pointer to an instance of this class. |
## Remarks



Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instances of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.
