## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ByteArrayContent](./bytearraycontent/) | Represents HTTP content as a byte array. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [HttpClient](./httpclient/) | Represents a base class of an HTTP client for sending requests and receiving responses. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [HttpClientHandler](./httpclienthandler/) | Represents the default message handler used by the [HttpClient](./httpclient/) class. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [HttpContent](./httpcontent/) | Represents content of an HTTP entity. [Object](../system/object/) of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [HttpMessageHandler](./httpmessagehandler/) | Represents a base type for the HTTP message handlers. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [HttpMessageInvoker](./httpmessageinvoker/) | Allows applications to call the Send method on an HTTP handler chain. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [HttpMethod](./httpmethod/) | Represents an HTTP method. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [HttpRequestMessage](./httprequestmessage/) | Represents an HTTP request message. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [HttpResponseMessage](./httpresponsemessage/) | Represents an HTTP response message. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [HttpUtilities](./httputilities/) | Contains the utility methods. |
| [StringContent](./stringcontent/) | Represents HTTP content as a string. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
