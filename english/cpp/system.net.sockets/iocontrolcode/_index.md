## IOControlCode enum


Enumerates the [IO](../../system.io/) control codes.

```cpp
enum class IOControlCode : int64_t
```

| Flush | 671088644 | Discards current contents of the sending queue associated with this socket. |
| GetBroadcastAddress | 1207959557 | Return a SOCKADDR structure that contains the broadcast address for the address family of the current socket. |

| MultipointLoopback | -2013265911 | Control whether data sent by an application on the local computer (not necessarily by the same socket) in a multicast session will be received by a socket joined to the multicast destination group on the loopback interface. |
| MulticastScope | -2013265910 | Control the number of times a multicast packet can be forwarded by a router, also known as TTL, or hop count. |
| SetQos | -2013265909 | Set the QOS attributes for the socket. |
| SetGroupQos | -2013265908 | Set the QOS attributes for the socket group. |
| TranslateHandle | -939524083 | Return a handle for the socket that is valid in the context of a companion interface. |
| RoutingInterfaceQuery | -939524076 | Return the interface addresses that can be used to connect to the specified remote address. |
| RoutingInterfaceChange | -2013265899 | Enable receiving a notification when the local interface used to access a remote endpoint changes. |
| AddressListQuery | 1207959574 | Return the list of the local interfaces that the socket can bind to. |
| AddressListChange | 671088663 | Enable receiving a notification when the list of the local interfaces for the socket's protocol family changes. |
| QueryTargetPnpHandle | 1207959576 | Retrieve the underlying provider's SOCKET handle. |
| NamespaceChange | -2013265895 | Control whether the socket receives notification when a namespace query becomes invalid. |
| AddressListSort | -939524071 | Sort a list of IPv6 and IPv4 destination addresses to determine the best available address for making a connection. |
| ReceiveAll | -1744830463 | Enable receiving all IPv4 packets on the network. |

| ReceiveAllIgmpMulticast | -1744830461 | Enable receiving all IGMP packets on the network. |
| KeepAliveValues | -1744830460 | Control sending TCP keep-alive packets and the interval at which they are sent. |
| AbsorbRouterAlert | -1744830459 | This value is equal to the Winsock 2 'SIO_ABSORB_RTRALERT' constant. |
| UnicastInterface | -1744830458 | Set the interface used for the outgoing unicast packets. |
| LimitBroadcasts | -1744830457 | This value is equal to the Winsock 2 'SIO_LIMIT_BROADCASTS' constant. |
