## X509KeyUsageExtension class


Extension object to keep extra information about the usage of a key. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class X509KeyUsageExtension : public System::Security::Cryptography::X509Certificates::X509Extension
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
