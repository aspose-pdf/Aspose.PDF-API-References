The **[Aspose.Pdf.Annotations](./)** namespace provides classes for working with various types of actions, destinations and other features of document which traditionally called as interactive providing means user can intercommunicate with it.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ActionCollection](./actioncollection/) | [Collection](../aspose.pdf/collection/) of actions. |
| [Annotation](./annotation/) | Class representing annotation object. |
| [AnnotationActionCollection](./annotationactioncollection/) | Represents the collection of annotation actions. |
| [AnnotationCollection](./annotationcollection/) | Class representing annotation collection. |
| [AnnotationFlagsConverter](./annotationflagsconverter/) |  |
| [AnnotationSelector](./annotationselector/) | This class is used for selecting annotations using Visitor template idea. |
| [AnnotationStateConverter](./annotationstateconverter/) |  |
| [AnnotationStateModelConverter](./annotationstatemodelconverter/) |  |
| [AppearanceDictionary](./appearancedictionary/) | [Annotation](./annotation/) appearance dictionary specifying how the annotation shall be presented visually on the page. |
| [BleedMarkAnnotation](./bleedmarkannotation/) | Represents a Bleed Mark annotation. |
| [Border](./border/) | Class representing characteristics of annotation border. |
| [BorderEffectConverter](./bordereffectconverter/) |  |
| [BorderStyleConverter](./borderstyleconverter/) |  |
| [CaptionPositionConverter](./captionpositionconverter/) |  |

| [Characteristics](./characteristics/) | Represents annotation characteristics. |
| [CircleAnnotation](./circleannotation/) | Class representing Circle annotation. |
| [ColorBarAnnotation](./colorbarannotation/) | Class representing [ColorBarAnnotation](./colorbarannotation/) annotation. Property [Color](../aspose.pdf/color/) ignored, instead used ColorsOfCMYK color. On creation, the ratio of width and height determines the orientation of the annotation - horizontal or vertical. Next, it checks that the annotation rectangle is outside the TrimBox, and if not, then it is shifted to the nearest location outside the TrimBox, taking into account the orientation of the annotation. It is possible to reduce the width (height) so that the annotation fits outside the TrimBox. If there is no space for the layout, the width/height can be set to zero (in this case, the annotation is present on the page, but not displayed). |

A null value for any of the parameters may result in unpredictable behavior. |
| [FitVExplicitDestination](./fitvexplicitdestination/) | Represents explicit destination that displays the page with the horizontal coordinate left positioned at the left edge of the window and the contents of the page magnified just enough to fit the entire height of the page within the window. A null value for left specifies that the current value of that parameter is to be retained unchanged. |
| [FixedPrint](./fixedprint/) | Represent Fixed print data of [Watermark](../aspose.pdf/watermark/)[Annotation](./annotation/). |
