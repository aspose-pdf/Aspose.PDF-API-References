Returns a reverse iterator to the element following the last element of the reversed container. It corresponds to the element preceding the first element of the non-reversed container. This element acts as a placeholder, attempting to access it results in undefined behavior.

```cpp
const_reverse_iterator System::Collections::Specialized::StringCollection::crend() const noexcept
```


### ReturnValue

An iterator pointing to the theoretical const-qualified element preceding the first element of the container.
