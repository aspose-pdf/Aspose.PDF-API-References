## StringCollection::end() const method


Returns an iterator to the element following the last element of the const-qualified container. This element acts as a placeholder; attempting to access it results in undefined behavior.

```cpp
const_iterator System::Collections::Specialized::StringCollection::end() const noexcept
```


### ReturnValue

An iterator pointing to the theoretical element placed after the last element of the const-qualified container.
