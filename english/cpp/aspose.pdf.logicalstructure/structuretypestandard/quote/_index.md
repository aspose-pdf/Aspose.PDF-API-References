## Quote field




```cpp
static ASPOSE_PDF_SHARED_API System::SharedPtr<StructureTypeStandard> Aspose::Pdf::LogicalStructure::StructureTypeStandard::Quote
```

## Remarks


(Quotation) An inline portion of text attributed to someone other than the author of the surrounding text.

The quoted text should be contained inline within a single paragraph. This differs from the block-level element BlockQuote, which consists of one or more complete paragraphs (or other elements presented as if they were complete paragraphs).
