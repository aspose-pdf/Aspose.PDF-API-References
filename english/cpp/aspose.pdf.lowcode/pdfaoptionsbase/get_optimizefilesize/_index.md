## PdfAOptionsBase::get_OptimizeFileSize method


Gets a value indicating whether to try to reduce the file size during the PDF/A conversion process.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Pdf::LowCode::PdfAOptionsBase::get_OptimizeFileSize()
```

## Remarks


**true**

if the file size should be reduced as much as possible; otherwise, **false**

. 

When set to **true**

, the conversion process will attempt to minimize the resulting file size. This might affect the conversion process performance.
