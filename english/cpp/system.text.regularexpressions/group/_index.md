## Group class


Result of matching done by single capturing group. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class Group : public System::Text::RegularExpressions::Capture
```

## Methods

| [get_Captures](./get_captures/)() | Gets available captures. |
| [get_Success](./get_success/)() | Checks if capturing was successful for this group. |
| [Group](./group/)(const UStringPtr\&, int, int) | Constructor. |
