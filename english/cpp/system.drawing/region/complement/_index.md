## Region::Complement(const Rectangle\&) method


Replaces the region represented by the current object with the portion of the region defined by the specified recangle that does not intersect with this region.

```cpp
void System::Drawing::Region::Complement(const Rectangle &rect)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rect | const Rectangle\& | A rectangle that defines a region to complement |
