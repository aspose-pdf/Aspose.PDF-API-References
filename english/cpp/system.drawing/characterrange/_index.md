## CharacterRange class


Represents a range of character positions in a string. This type should be allocated on stack and passed to functions by value or by reference. Never use [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) class to manage objects of this type.

```cpp
class CharacterRange
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CharacterRange](./characterrange/)(int32_t, int32_t) | Constructs a new instance of [CharacterRange](./) class that represents the specified range. |
| [CharacterRange](./characterrange/)() | Constructs a new instance of [CharacterRange](./) class that represents an empty range. |
| [get_First](./get_first/)() const | Returns the position of the first character of the range represented by the current object. |
| [get_Length](./get_length/)() const | Returns the number of characters in the range represented by the current object. |
| [operator!=](./operator!=/)(const CharacterRange\&) const | Determines if the current and specified objects represent distinct ranges. |
| [operator==](./operator==/)(const CharacterRange\&) const | Determines if the current and specified objects represent the same range. |
| [set_First](./set_first/)(int32_t) | Sets the position of the first character of the range represented by the current object. |
| [set_Length](./set_length/)(int32_t) | Returns the number of characters in the range represented by the current object. |
