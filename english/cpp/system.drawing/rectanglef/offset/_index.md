## RectangleF::Offset(const PointF\&) method


Offsets the position of the rectangle represented by the current object by the specified amounts.

```cpp
void System::Drawing::RectangleF::Offset(const PointF &pos)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | const PointF\& | The [PointF](../../pointf/) object that specifies the amount by which the rectangle is offset; the point's X coordinat value specifies the amount to add to the X coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle and the point's Y coordinate specifies the amount to add to the Y coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle |
