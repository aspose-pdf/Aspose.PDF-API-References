## SizeF class


Represents a pair of single-precision floating point values that represent width and height of an image. This type should be allocated on stack and passed to functions by value or by reference. Never use [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) class to manage objects of this type.

```cpp
class SizeF
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Add](./add/)(const SizeF\&, const SizeF\&) | Returns a new [SizeF](./) object that is a sum of the specified [SizeF](./) objects, i.e. whose width value is equal to the sum of width values of the specified objects and height value is equal to the sum of height values of the specified objects. |
| [Equals](./equals/)(const SizeF\&) const | Determines if the current object and the specified object are equal, i.e. represent the same pair of width and hegiht values. |
| [get_Height](./get_height/)() const | Returns the value of height represented by the current object. |
| [get_IsEmpty](./get_isempty/)() const | Determines if both width and hegiht values are equal to 0. |
| [get_Width](./get_width/)() const | Returns the value of width represented by the current object. |
| [GetHashCode](./gethashcode/)() const | Returns a hash code for the current object. |
| [operator PointF](./operatorpointf/)() const | Converts the current object to an instance of [Point](../point/) object by initializing its X and Y coordinate with the current object's width and height values correspondingly. |
| [operator+=](./operator+=/)(const SizeF\&) | Adds the specified [SizeF](./) object's width and height values to the width and height values of the current [SizeF](./) object correspondingly. |
| [set_Height](./set_height/)(float) | Sets the value of height represented by the current object. |
| [set_Width](./set_width/)(float) | Sets the value of width represented by the current object. |
| [SizeF](./sizef/)() | Constructs a new [SizeF](./) object and initializes its width and height values with 0. |
| [SizeF](./sizef/)(const PointF\&) | Constructs a new [SizeF](./) object and initializes its width and height values with the values of X and Y coordinates of the specifide point correspondingly. |
| [SizeF](./sizef/)(float, float) | Constructs a new [SizeF](./) object and initializes it with the specified value. |
| static [Subtract](./subtract/)(const SizeF\&, const SizeF\&) | Returns a new [SizeF](./) object that is the results of subctraction of **size2** from **size1**, i.e. whose width value is the result of subtraction of **size2's** width value from **size1's** width value and height value is the result of subtraction of **size2's** height value from **size1's** height value. |
| [ToPointF](./topointf/)() const | Converts the current object to an instance of [Point](../point/) object by initializing its X and Y coordinate with the current object's width and height values correspondingly. |
| [ToSize](./tosize/)() const | Constructs a [Size](../size/) object from the current [SizeF](./) object by truncating the [SizeF](./) object's width and height values to the next lower integer values. |
| [ToString](./tostring/)() const | Returns the string representation of the pair of width and hegiht values represented by the current object. |
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Empty](./empty/) | An empty instance of [SizeF](./) class whose width and height values are 0. |
