## Matrix::Scale(float, float) method


Applies the specified scale vector to the matrix represented by the current object.

```cpp
void System::Drawing::Drawing2D::Matrix::Scale(float scaleX, float scaleY)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| scaleX | float | The value by which to scale the matrix in x-axis direction |
| scaleY | float | The value by which to scale the matrix in y-axis direction |

## Matrix::Scale(float, float, MatrixOrder) method


Applies the specified scale vector to the matrix represented by the current object.

```cpp
void System::Drawing::Drawing2D::Matrix::Scale(float scaleX, float scaleY, MatrixOrder order)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| scaleX | float | The value by which to scale the matrix in x-axis direction |
| scaleY | float | The value by which to scale the matrix in y-axis direction |
| order | MatrixOrder | The order in which the scale vector is applied to the matrix |
