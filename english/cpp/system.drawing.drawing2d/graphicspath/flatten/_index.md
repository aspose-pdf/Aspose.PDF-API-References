## GraphicsPath::Flatten(const MatrixPtr\&) method


Flattens each curve in the path by converting them into a series of connected lines. The flatness value of 0.25 is used.

```cpp
void System::Drawing::Drawing2D::GraphicsPath::Flatten(const MatrixPtr &matrix)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| matrix | const MatrixPtr\& | The transform matrix to apply to the path before flattening |

## GraphicsPath::Flatten(const MatrixPtr\&, float) method


Flattens each curve in the path by converting them into a series of connected lines.

```cpp
void System::Drawing::Drawing2D::GraphicsPath::Flatten(const MatrixPtr &matrix, float flatness)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| matrix | const MatrixPtr\& | The transform matrix to apply to the path before flattening |
| flatness | float | Specifies the maximum permitted error between the curve and its flattened approximation |
