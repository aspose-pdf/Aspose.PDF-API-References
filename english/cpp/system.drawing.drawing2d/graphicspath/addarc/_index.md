## GraphicsPath::AddArc(const Rectangle\&, float, float) method


Adds the specified elliptical arc to the path represented by the current object.

```cpp
void System::Drawing::Drawing2D::GraphicsPath::AddArc(const Rectangle &rect, float startAngle, float sweepAngle)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rect | const Rectangle\& | The rectangle that bounds the ellipse from which the arc is drawn |
| startAngle | float | Specifies the starting angle of the arc in degrees, measured clockwise from the X-axis |
| sweepAngle | float | Specifies the angle between the starting angle and the end of the arc |
