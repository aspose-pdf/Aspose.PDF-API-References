## AdjustableArrowCap class


Represents an adjustable arrow-shaped line cap. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class AdjustableArrowCap : public System::Drawing::Drawing2D::CustomLineCap
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AdjustableArrowCap](./adjustablearrowcap/)(float, float, bool) | Constructs a new instance of [AdjustableArrowCap](./) with the specified width and height. |
| [get_Filled](./get_filled/)() const | Returns a value that indicates if the arrow represented by the current object is filled. |
| [get_Height](./get_height/)() const | Returns the height of the arrow represented by the current object. |
| [get_MiddleInset](./get_middleinset/)() const | Sets the distance between the line and the cap represented by the current object. |
| [get_Width](./get_width/)() const | Returns the width of the arrow represented by the current object. |
| [set_Filled](./set_filled/)(bool) | Sets a value that specifies if the arrow represented by the current object is filled. |
| [set_Height](./set_height/)(float) | Sets the height of the arrow represented by the current object. |
