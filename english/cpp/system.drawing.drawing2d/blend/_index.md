## Blend class


Represents a blend pattern for a [LinearGradientBrush](../lineargradientbrush/) object. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class Blend : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Blend](./blend/)() | Constructs a new instance of [Blend](./) class. |
| [Blend](./blend/)(int) | Constructs a new instance of [Blend](./) class. |
| [get_Factors](./get_factors/)() const | Returns the array of blend factors of the gradient. |
| [get_Positions](./get_positions/)() const | Returns the array of blend positions of the gradient. |
| [set_Factors](./set_factors/)(const ArrayPtr\<float\>\&) | Sets the array of blend factors of the gradient. |
| [set_Positions](./set_positions/)(const ArrayPtr\<float\>\&) | Sets the array of blend positions of the gradient. |
