## RenderingOptions::get_AnalyzeFonts method


Replaces fonts as necessary to ensure all characters in the text can be displayed. The font substitution algorithm follows these steps:

```cpp
bool Aspose::Pdf::RenderingOptions::get_AnalyzeFonts() const
```

## Remarks


1. If the user explicitly sets the DefaultFontName property, check if the specified font can display the desired characters.
1. If no user-defined font is set, search through fonts added via the [FontRepository::Sources](../).
1. Analyze the text to identify its alphabet or script and suggest font names accordingly. Attempt to locate and use these fonts from the system.
1. As a fallback, search the system for any font capable of displaying the required characters.
