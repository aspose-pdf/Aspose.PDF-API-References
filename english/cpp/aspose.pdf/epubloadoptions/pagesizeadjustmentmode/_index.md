## PageSizeAdjustmentMode field


ATTENTION! The feature implemented but did not put yet to public API since blocker issue in OSHARED layer revealed for sample document.

```cpp
LoadOptions::PageSizeAdjustmentModes Aspose::Pdf::EpubLoadOptions::PageSizeAdjustmentMode
```

## Remarks


Represents mode of usage of page size during conversion. Formats (like HTML, EPUB etc), usually have float design, so, it allows to fit required pagesize. But sometimes content has specified horizontal positions or size that does not allow put content into required page size. In such case we can define what should be done in this case (i.e when size of content does not fit required initial page size of result PDF document).
