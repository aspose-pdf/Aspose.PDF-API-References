## OptimizedMemoryStream::Write method


When overridden in a derived class, writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written.

```cpp
void Aspose::Pdf::OptimizedMemoryStream::Write(const System::ArrayPtr<uint8_t> &buffer, int32_t offset, int32_t count) override
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const System::ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\& | An array of bytes. This method copies *count*  bytes from *buffer*  to the current stream. |
| offset | int32_t | The zero-based byte offset in *buffer*  at which to begin copying bytes to the current stream. |
| count | int32_t | The number of bytes to be written to the current stream. |
## Remarks



The sum of *offset*  and *count*  is greater than the buffer length.
