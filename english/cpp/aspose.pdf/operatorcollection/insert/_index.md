## OperatorCollection::Insert(int32_t, System::ArrayPtr\<System::SharedPtr\<Operator\>\>) method


Insert operators at the the given position.

```cpp
void Aspose::Pdf::OperatorCollection::Insert(int32_t at, System::ArrayPtr<System::SharedPtr<Operator>> ops)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| at | int32_t | Index from which operators are being started to insert. |
| ops | System::ArrayPtr\<System::SharedPtr\<Operator\>\> | Array of operators to be inserted. Each operator can have any index (by default -1) because their indices adjusted automatically starting from *at* . |
