If angle set by ArbitraryAngle is not multiple of 90 then Rotate property returns Rotation.None in C++.'

## Stamp::get_Rotate method


Sets or gets the rotation of stamp content according [Rotation](../../rotation/) values. [Note](../../note/). This property is for set angles which are multiples of 90 degrees (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees). To set arbitrary angle use RotateAngle property. If angle set by ArbitraryAngle is not multiple of 90 then Rotate property returns [Rotation.None](../../rotation/).
