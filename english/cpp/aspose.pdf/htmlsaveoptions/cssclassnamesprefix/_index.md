## CssClassNamesPrefix field


When PDFtoHTML converter generates result CSSs, CSS class names (something like ".stl_01 {}" ... ".stl_NN {}) are generated
and used in result CSS. This property allows forcibly set class name prefix
For example, if You want that all class names start with 'my_prefix_'
(i.e. were something like 'my_prefix_1' ... 'my_prefix_NNN' ) , 
then just assign 'my_prefix_' to this property before conversion.
If this property will stay untouched(i.e. null will be leaved as value ), then
converter will generate class names itself 
(it wil be something like ".stl_01 {}" ... ".stl_NN {}")
