## AutoTaggingSettings::get_HeadingRecognitionStrategy method


Gets the strategy used for recognizing headings in the document during auto-tagging.

```cpp
Aspose::Pdf::HeadingRecognitionStrategy Aspose::Pdf::AutoTaggingSettings::get_HeadingRecognitionStrategy() const
```

## Remarks


The [HeadingRecognitionStrategy](../../headingrecognitionstrategy/) property determines how headings are identified in the document. Available strategies include recognizing headings based on outlines, heuristic analysis, or automatic detection. Setting this property to [HeadingRecognitionStrategy::None](../../headingrecognitionstrategy/) disables heading recognition.
