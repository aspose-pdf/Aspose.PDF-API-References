| [set_CachePolicy](./set_cachepolicy/)(const SharedPtr\<Net::Cache::RequestCachePolicy\>\&) | Sets the cache policy for the underlying WebRequest object. |
| [set_Credentials](./set_credentials/)(SharedPtr\<Net::ICredentials\>) override | Sets credentials used to authenticate web requests. |
| [set_Proxy](./set_proxy/)(const SharedPtr\<Net::IWebProxy\>\&) | Sets the network proxy for the underlying WebRequest object. |

## Remarks



Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instances of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.
