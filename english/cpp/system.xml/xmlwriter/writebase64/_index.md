## XmlWriter::WriteBase64 method


When overridden in a derived class, encodes the specified binary bytes as Base64 and writes out the resulting text.

```cpp
virtual void System::Xml::XmlWriter::WriteBase64(ArrayPtr<uint8_t> buffer, int32_t index, int32_t count)=0
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\> | [Byte](../../../system/byte/) array to encode. |
| index | int32_t | The position in the buffer indicating the start of the bytes to write. |
| count | int32_t | The number of bytes to write. |
