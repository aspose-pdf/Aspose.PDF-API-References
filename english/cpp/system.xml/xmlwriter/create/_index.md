## XmlWriter::Create(const SharedPtr\<IO::Stream\>\&) method


Creates a new [XmlWriter](../) instance using the specified stream.

```cpp
static SharedPtr<XmlWriter> System::Xml::XmlWriter::Create(const SharedPtr<IO::Stream> &output)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| output | const SharedPtr\<IO::Stream\>\& | The stream to which you want to write. The [XmlWriter](../) writes XML 1.0 text syntax and appends it to the specified stream. |

### ReturnValue

An [XmlWriter](../) object.

## XmlWriter::Create(const SharedPtr\<IO::Stream\>\&, SharedPtr\<XmlWriterSettings\>) method


Creates a new [XmlWriter](../) instance using the stream and [XmlWriterSettings](../../xmlwritersettings/) object.

```cpp
static SharedPtr<XmlWriter> System::Xml::XmlWriter::Create(const SharedPtr<IO::Stream> &output, SharedPtr<XmlWriterSettings> settings)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| output | const SharedPtr\<IO::Stream\>\& | The stream to which you want to write. The [XmlWriter](../) writes XML 1.0 text syntax and appends it to the specified stream. |
| settings | SharedPtr\<XmlWriterSettings\> | The [XmlWriterSettings](../../xmlwritersettings/) object used to configure the new [XmlWriter](../) instance. If this is **nullptr**, a [XmlWriterSettings](../../xmlwritersettings/) with default settings is used. If the [XmlWriter](../) is being used with the XslCompiledTransform:Transform(String,SharedPtr<XmlWriter>) method, you should use the XslCompiledTransform::get_OutputSettings value to obtain an [XmlWriterSettings](../../xmlwritersettings/) object with the correct settings. This ensures that the created [XmlWriter](../) object has the correct output settings. |

### ReturnValue

An [XmlWriter](../) object.
