## XmlReader::ReadValueChunk method


Reads large streams of text embedded in an XML document.

```cpp
virtual int32_t System::Xml::XmlReader::ReadValueChunk(ArrayPtr<char16_t> buffer, int32_t index, int32_t count)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | ArrayPtr\<char16_t\> | The array of characters that serves as the buffer to which the text contents are written. This value cannot be **nullptr**. |
| index | int32_t | The offset within the buffer where the [XmlReader](../) can start to copy the results. |
| count | int32_t | The maximum number of characters to copy into the buffer. The actual number of characters copied is returned from this method. |
