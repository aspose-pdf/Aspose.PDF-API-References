## XmlReader::ReadString method


When overridden in a derived class, reads the contents of an element or text node as a string. However, it is recommended to use the [XmlReader::ReadElementContentAsString](../readelementcontentasstring/) method instead, because it provides a more straightforward way to handle this operation.

```cpp
virtual String System::Xml::XmlReader::ReadString()
```


### ReturnValue

The contents of the element or an empty string.
