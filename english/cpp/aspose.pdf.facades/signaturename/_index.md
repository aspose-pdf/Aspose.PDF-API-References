## SignatureName class


Represents a class for a signature name.

```cpp
class SignatureName : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Equals](./equals/)(System::SharedPtr\<System::Object\>) override | Determines whether this instance and a specified object are equal. |
| [get_HasSignature](./get_hassignature/)() | Indicates whether the signature is present or not. |
| [GetHashCode](./gethashcode/)() const override | Returns a hash code for this instance based on the FullName property. |
| [ToString](./tostring/)() const override | Returns a string representation of the [SignatureName](./) instance, primarily using its name. |
## Remarks


Represents a more precise signature name. Used instead of string names. Allows you to present signatures with the same string names.
