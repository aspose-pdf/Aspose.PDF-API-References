## SignatureName class


Represents a class for a signature name.

```cpp
class SignatureName : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_HasSignature](./get_hassignature/)() | Indicates whether the signature is present or not. |
| [ToString](./tostring/)() const override | Returns a string representation of the [SignatureName](./) instance, primarily using its name. |
