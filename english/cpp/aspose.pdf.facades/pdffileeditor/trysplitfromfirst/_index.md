## PdfFileEditor::TrySplitFromFirst(System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\>, int32_t, System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\>) method


Splits from start to specified location,and saves the front part in output Stream.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Pdf::Facades::PdfFileEditor::TrySplitFromFirst(System::SharedPtr<System::IO::Stream> inputStream, int32_t location, System::SharedPtr<System::IO::Stream> outputStream)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inputStream | System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\> | Source [Pdf](../../../aspose.pdf/) file Stream. |
| location | int32_t | The splitting point. |
| outputStream | System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\> | Output file Stream. |

### ReturnValue

True for success, or false.
## Remarks



The streams are NOT closed after this operation. The TrySplitFromFirst method is like the SplitFromFirst method, except the TrySplitFromFirst method does not throw an exception if the operation fails.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Pdf::Facades::PdfFileEditor::TrySplitFromFirst(System::SharedPtr<System::IO::Stream> inputStream, int32_t location, System::SharedPtr<System::Web::HttpResponse> response)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inputStream | System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\> | Stream of source document. |
| location | int32_t | The splitting point. |
| response | System::SharedPtr\<System::Web::HttpResponse\> | HttpResponse object where result will be stored. |

### ReturnValue

true if operation completed successfully; otherwise, false.
## Remarks



The TrySplitFromFirst method is like the SplitFromFirst method, except the TrySplitFromFirst method does not throw an exception if the operation fails.
