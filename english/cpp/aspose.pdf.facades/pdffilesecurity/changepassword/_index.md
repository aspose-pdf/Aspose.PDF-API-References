## PdfFileSecurity::ChangePassword(System::String, System::String, System::String) method


Changes the user password and owner password by owner password, keeps the original security settings. The new user password and the new owner password can be null or empty. The owner password will be replaced with a random string if the new owner password is null or empty. Throws an exception if process failed.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Pdf::Facades::PdfFileSecurity::ChangePassword(System::String ownerPassword, System::String newUserPassword, System::String newOwnerPassword)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ownerPassword | System::String | Original Owner password. |
| newUserPassword | System::String | New User password. |
| newOwnerPassword | System::String | New Owner password. |

### ReturnValue

True for success.

## PdfFileSecurity::ChangePassword(System::String, System::String, System::String, System::SharedPtr\<DocumentPrivilege\>, KeySize) method


Changes the user password and password by owner password, allows to reset [Pdf](../../../aspose.pdf/) documnent security. The new user password and the new owner password can be null or empty. The owner password will be replaced with a random string if the new owner password is null or empty. Throws an exception if process failed.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Pdf::Facades::PdfFileSecurity::ChangePassword(System::String ownerPassword, System::String newUserPassword, System::String newOwnerPassword, System::SharedPtr<DocumentPrivilege> privilege, KeySize keySize)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ownerPassword | System::String | Original owner password. |
| newUserPassword | System::String | New User password. |
| newOwnerPassword | System::String | New Owner password. |
| privilege | System::SharedPtr\<DocumentPrivilege\> | Reset security. |
| keySize | KeySize | [KeySize.x40](../../keysize/) for 40 bits encryption, [KeySize.x128](../../keysize/) for 128 bits encryption and [KeySize.x256](../../keysize/) for 256 bits encryption. |

## PdfFileSecurity::ChangePassword(System::String, System::String, System::String, System::SharedPtr\<DocumentPrivilege\>, KeySize, Algorithm) method


Changes the user password and password by owner password, allows to reset [Pdf](../../../aspose.pdf/) documnent security. The new user password and the new owner password can be null or empty. The owner password will be replaced with a random string if the new owner password is null or empty. There are 6 possible combinations of KeySize and Algorithm values. However ([KeySize.x40](../../keysize/), [Algorithm.AES](../../algorithm/)) and ([KeySize.x256](../../keysize/), [Algorithm.RC4](../../algorithm/)) are invalid and corresponding exception will be raised if kit encounters this combination. Throws an exception if process failed.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Pdf::Facades::PdfFileSecurity::ChangePassword(System::String ownerPassword, System::String newUserPassword, System::String newOwnerPassword, System::SharedPtr<DocumentPrivilege> privilege, KeySize keySize, Algorithm cipher)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ownerPassword | System::String | Original owner password. |
| newUserPassword | System::String | New User password. |
| newOwnerPassword | System::String | New Owner password. |
| privilege | System::SharedPtr\<DocumentPrivilege\> | Reset security. |
| keySize | KeySize | [KeySize.x40](../../keysize/) for 40 bits encryption, [KeySize.x128](../../keysize/) for 128 bits encryption and [KeySize.x256](../../keysize/) for 256 bits encryption. |
| cipher | Algorithm | [Algorithm.AES](../../algorithm/) to encrypt using AES algorithm or [Algorithm.RC4](../../algorithm/) for RC4 encryption. |

### ReturnValue

True for success.
