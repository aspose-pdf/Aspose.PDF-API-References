## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Close](./close/)() override | Closes opened files without any changes. |
| [ExportFdf](./exportfdf/)(System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\>) | Exports the content of the fields of the pdf into the fdf stream. |
| [ExportXfdf](./exportxfdf/)(System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\>) | Exports the content of the fields of the pdf into the xml stream. The button field's value will not be exported. |
| [ExportXml](./exportxml/)(System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\>) | Exports the content of the fields of the pdf into the xml stream. The button field's value will not be exported. |
| [ExtractXfaData](./extractxfadata/)(System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\>) | Extracts XFA data packet. |

| [FillField](./fillfield/)(System::String, System::String) | Fills the field with a valid value according to a fully qualified field name. Before filling the fields, every field's names and its corresponding valid values must be known. Both the fields' name and values are case sensitive. Please note that [Aspose.Pdf.Facades](../) supports only full field names and does not work with partial field names in contrast with Aspose.Pdf.Kit; For example if field has full name "Form.Subform.TextField" you should specify full name and not "TextField". You can use FieldNames property to explore existing field names and search required field by its partial name. |
| [FillField](./fillfield/)(System::String, int32_t) | Fills the radio box field with a valid index value according to a fully qualified field name. Before filling the fields, only field's name must be known. While the value can be specified by its index. Notice: Only be applied to Radio Box, Combo Box and List Box fields. Please note that [Aspose.Pdf.Facades](../) supports only full field names and does not work with partial field names in contrast with Aspose.Pdf.Kit; For example if field has full name "Form.Subform.ListBoxField" you should specify full name and not "ListBoxField". You can use FieldNames property to explore existing field names and search required field by its partial name. |
| [FillField](./fillfield/)(System::String, bool) | Fills the check box field with a boolean value. Notice: Only be applied to Check Box. Please note that [Aspose.Pdf.Facades](../) supports only full field names and does not work with partial field names in contrast with Aspose.Pdf.Kit; For example if field has full name "Form.Subform.CheckBoxField" you should specify full name and not "CheckBoxField". You can use FieldNames property to explore existing field names and search required field by its partial name. |
