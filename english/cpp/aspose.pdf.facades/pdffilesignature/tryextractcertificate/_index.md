## PdfFileSignature::TryExtractCertificate(System::SharedPtr\<SignatureName\>, System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\>\&) method


Extracts signature's single X.509 certificate as a stream.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Pdf::Facades::PdfFileSignature::TryExtractCertificate(System::SharedPtr<SignatureName> signName, System::SharedPtr<System::IO::Stream> &stream)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| signName | System::SharedPtr\<SignatureName\> | The name of signature. |
| stream | System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\>\& | If a certificate was found returns X.509 single certificate stream; otherwise, null. |

### ReturnValue

True certificate was found.
