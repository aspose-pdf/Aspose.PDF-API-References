## BackgroundWorker class


Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class BackgroundWorker : public System::ComponentModel::Component
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BackgroundWorker](./backgroundworker/)() | RTTI information. |
| [get_WorkerReportsProgress](./get_workerreportsprogress/)() const | Gets a value indicating whether the [System::ComponentModel::BackgroundWorker](./) can report progress updates. |
| [ReportProgress](./reportprogress/)(int) | Raises the [System::ComponentModel::BackgroundWorker::ProgressChanged](./progresschanged/) event. |
| [ReportProgress](./reportprogress/)(int, const System::SharedPtr\<System::Object\>\&) | Raises the [System::ComponentModel::BackgroundWorker::ProgressChanged](./progresschanged/) event with userState object. |
| [RunWorkerAsync](./runworkerasync/)() | Starts execution of a background operation. |
| [RunWorkerAsync](./runworkerasync/)(const System::SharedPtr\<System::Object\>\&) | Starts execution of a background operation. |
| [set_WorkerReportsProgress](./set_workerreportsprogress/)(bool) | Sets a value indicating whether the [System::ComponentModel::BackgroundWorker](./) can report progress updates. |
| [~BackgroundWorker](./~backgroundworker/)() | Destructor. |
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DoWork](./dowork/) | Occurs when [System::ComponentModel::BackgroundWorker::RunWorkerAsync](./runworkerasync/) is called. |
| [ProgressChanged](./progresschanged/) | Occurs when [System::ComponentModel::BackgroundWorker::ReportProgress(int)](./reportprogress/) is called. |
| [RunWorkerCompleted](./runworkercompleted/) | Occurs when the background operation has completed, has been canceled, or has raised an exception. |
