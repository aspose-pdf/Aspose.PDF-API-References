## Component class


Dummy class to make translated code using [Component](./) class compilable. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class Component : public System::MarshalByRefObject,
                  public System::ComponentModel::IComponent
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |

| [Component](./component/)() | RTTI information. |
| [Dispose](./dispose/)(bool) | Disposable pattern support; does nothing. |
| [get_DesignMode](./get_designmode/)() | Checks if component is in design mode. |
