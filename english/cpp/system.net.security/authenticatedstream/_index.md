## AuthenticatedStream class


Contains the methods for passing credentials across a stream. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class AuthenticatedStream : public System::IO::Stream
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| virtual [get_IsAuthenticated](./get_isauthenticated/)() const | Returns a value that indicates if authentication is successfully passed. |
| virtual [get_IsEncrypted](./get_isencrypted/)() const | Returns a value that indicates if the data sent using this stream is encrypted. |
| virtual [get_IsMutuallyAuthenticated](./get_ismutuallyauthenticated/)() const | Returns a value that indicates if a server and a client are authenticated. |
| virtual [get_IsServer](./get_isserver/)() const | Returns a value that indicates if the local side of the connection is the server. |
| virtual [get_IsSigned](./get_issigned/)() const | Returns a value that indicates if the data sent using this stream is signed. |
| [get_LeaveInnerStreamOpen](./get_leaveinnerstreamopen/)() const | RTTI information. |
## Fields
