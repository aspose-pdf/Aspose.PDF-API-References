## TextState::get_BackgroundColor method


Sets background color of the text.

```cpp
virtual System::SharedPtr<Color> Aspose::Pdf::Text::TextState::get_BackgroundColor()
```

## Remarks


[Note](../../../aspose.pdf/note/) that the value is not preserved as a text characteristic within the document. The BackgroundColor property getter works for an object in case it was explicitly set previously with BackgroundColor setter for those object.

The property is used by runtime in context of current generation/modification process.
