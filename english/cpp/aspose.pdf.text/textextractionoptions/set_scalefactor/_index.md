description: 'Aspose::Pdf::Text::TextExtractionOptions::set_ScaleFactor method. Sets factor that will be applied to scale font size during extraction in pure mode. Setting of less value leads to more spaces in the extracted text. Default value is 1 - no scaling; Setting value to zero allows algorithm choose scaling automatically in C++.'
