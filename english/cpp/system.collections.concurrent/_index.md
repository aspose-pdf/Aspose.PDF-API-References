## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ConcurrentDictionary](./concurrentdictionary/) | Thread-safe dictionary implementation. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
