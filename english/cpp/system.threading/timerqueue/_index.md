## TimerQueue class


Queue that handles [Timer](../timer/) objects. This is just an implementation. [Timer](../timer/) objects register there by themselves, you don't have to do so to use them - use [Timer](../timer/) class API instead. This is a singleton type with memory management done by access function(s). You should never create instances of it directly.

```cpp
class TimerQueue
```

| [Delete](./delete/)(Timer *) | Deletes timer from queue. |
| static [GetInstance](./getinstance/)() | Implementation singleton. |
| static [JoinWorkerThread](./joinworkerthread/)() | Joins worker thread. Waits infinitely if required. |
