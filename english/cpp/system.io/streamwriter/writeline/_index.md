## StreamWriter::WriteLine(const ArrayPtr\<char_t\>\&) method


Writes all characetrs from the specified array followed by the line-terminating characters to the stream.

```cpp
void System::IO::StreamWriter::WriteLine(const ArrayPtr<char_t> &buffer) override
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const ArrayPtr\<char_t\>\& | The array containing the characters to write |

## StreamWriter::WriteLine(const ArrayPtr\<char_t\>\&, int32_t, int32_t) method


Writes the specified subrange of UTF-16 characters from the specified character array followed by the line-terminating characters to the stream.

```cpp
void System::IO::StreamWriter::WriteLine(const ArrayPtr<char_t> &buffer, int32_t index, int32_t count) override
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const ArrayPtr\<char_t\>\& | The array containing the characters to write |
| index | int32_t | A 0-based index of the elemnet in **buffer** at which the subrange to write begins |
| count | int32_t | The number of characters in the subrange to write; -1 specifies that the subrange ends where **buffer** array ends |
