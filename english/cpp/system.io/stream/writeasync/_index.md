## Stream::WriteAsync(const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\&, int32_t, int32_t) method


Asynchronously writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream, advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written, and monitors cancellation requests.

```cpp
TaskPtr System::IO::Stream::WriteAsync(const ArrayPtr<uint8_t> &buffer, int32_t offset, int32_t count)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\& | The array containing the bytes to write. |
| offset | int32_t | A 0-based index of the elemnet in **buffer** at which the subrange to write begins. |
| count | int32_t | The number of elements in the subrange to write. |

### ReturnValue

A task that represents the asynchronous write operation.

## Stream::WriteAsync(const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\&, int32_t, int32_t, const Threading::CancellationToken\&) method


Asynchronously writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream, advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written, and monitors cancellation requests.

```cpp
virtual TaskPtr System::IO::Stream::WriteAsync(const ArrayPtr<uint8_t> &buffer, int32_t offset, int32_t count, const Threading::CancellationToken &cancellationToken)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\& | The array containing the bytes to write. |
| offset | int32_t | A 0-based index of the elemnet in **buffer** at which the subrange to write begins. |
| count | int32_t | The number of elements in the subrange to write. |
| cancellationToken | const Threading::CancellationToken\& | The token to monitor for cancellation requests. |

### ReturnValue

A task that represents the asynchronous write operation.
