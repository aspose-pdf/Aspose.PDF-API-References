## Stream::Write(const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\&, int32_t, int32_t) method


Writes the specified subrange of bytes from the specified byte array to the stream.

```cpp
virtual void System::IO::Stream::Write(const ArrayPtr<uint8_t> &buffer, int32_t offset, int32_t count)=0
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\& | The array containing the bytes to write |
| offset | int32_t | A 0-based index of the element in **buffer** at which the subrange to write begins |
| count | int32_t | The number of elements in the subrange to write |

```cpp
virtual void System::IO::Stream::Write(const System::Details::ArrayView<uint8_t> &buffer, int32_t offset, int32_t count)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const System::Details::ArrayView\<uint8_t\>\& | The array view containing the bytes to write |

```cpp
template<std::size_t> void System::IO::Stream::Write(const System::Details::StackArray<uint8_t, N> &buffer, int32_t offset, int32_t count)
```


| Parameter | Description |

| N | The size of the stack array |

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const System::Details::StackArray\<uint8_t, N\>\& | The stack array containing the bytes to write |
| offset | int32_t | A 0-based index of the element in **buffer** at which the subrange to write begins |
| count | int32_t | The number of elements in the subrange to write |
