## DirectoryInfo::GetFiles(const String\&) method


Searches for the files that satisfy the specified search criteria in the directory represented by the current object.

```cpp
ArrayPtr<FileInfoPtr> System::IO::DirectoryInfo::GetFiles(const String &searchPattern)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| searchPattern | const String\& | The name pattern of the files to search for |

### ReturnValue

## DirectoryInfo::GetFiles(const String\&, SearchOption) method


Searches for the files that satisfy the specified search criteria either in the directory represented by the current object or in the whole directory tree rooted in the directory represented by the current object.

```cpp
ArrayPtr<FileInfoPtr> System::IO::DirectoryInfo::GetFiles(const String &searchPattern, SearchOption searchOption)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| searchPattern | const String\& | The name pattern of the files to search for |
| searchOption | SearchOption | Specifies whether the search has to be performed in the directory represented by the current object only or in the whole directory tree rooted in the directory represented by the current object |

### ReturnValue

An array of shared pointers to [FileInfo](../../fileinfo/) objects representing the found files whose names match **searchPattern**
