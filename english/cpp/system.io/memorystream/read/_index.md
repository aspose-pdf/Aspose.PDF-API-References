## MemoryStream::Read(const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\&, int32_t, int32_t) method


Reads the specified number of bytes from the stream and writes them to the specified byte array.

```cpp
int32_t System::IO::MemoryStream::Read(const ArrayPtr<uint8_t> &buffer, int32_t offset, int32_t count) override
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\& | The byte array to write the read bytes to |
| offset | int32_t | A 0-based position in **buffer** to start writing at |
| count | int32_t | The number of bytes to read |

### ReturnValue

The number of bytes read
