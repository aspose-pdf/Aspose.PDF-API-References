## MemoryStream::Write(const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\&, int32_t, int32_t) method


Writes the specified subrange of bytes from the specified byte array to the stream.

```cpp
void System::IO::MemoryStream::Write(const ArrayPtr<uint8_t> &buffer, int32_t offset, int32_t count) override
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | const ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>\& | The array containing the bytes to write |
| offset | int32_t | A 0-based index of the elemnet in **buffer** at which the subrange to write begins |
| count | int32_t | The number of elements in the subrange to write |
