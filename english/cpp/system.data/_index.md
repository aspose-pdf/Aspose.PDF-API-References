## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DataColumn](./datacolumn/) | Describes column in data. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [DataColumnCollection](./datacolumncollection/) | Encapsulates collection of data columns. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [DataRelation](./datarelation/) | Describes parent-child relation between tables. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [DataRelationCollection](./datarelationcollection/) | Collection of dependencies between tables. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [DataRow](./datarow/) | Row in the data set. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [DataRowCollection](./datarowcollection/) | Collection of data rows. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [DataRowView](./datarowview/) | View over the data row. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [DataSet](./dataset/) | Set of data which is stored in tables having some relations between them. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [DataTable](./datatable/) | [Data](./) structured in rows and columns. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [DataTableCollection](./datatablecollection/) | Collection of data tables. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [DataView](./dataview/) | View working on table. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [IDataReader](./idatareader/) | Interface to read consequental data from. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [IDataRecord](./idatarecord/) | Interface to record with columns. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
