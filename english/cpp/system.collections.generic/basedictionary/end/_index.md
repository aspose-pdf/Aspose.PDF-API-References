## BaseDictionary::end method


Returns an iterator to the KVPair-wrapper for key-value-element following the last element of the container. Implemented in C# style - iterator should be return the KVPair-object with get_Key() and get_Value() interface. This element acts as a placeholder; attempting to access it results in undefined behavior.

```cpp
const_iterator System::Collections::Generic::BaseDictionary<Map>::end() const noexcept
```


### ReturnValue

An iterator pointing to the theoretical element placed after the end element of collection.
