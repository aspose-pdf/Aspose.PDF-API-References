## BaseDictionary::cend method


Returns an iterator to the element following the last element of the container. Implemented in STL-style. This element acts as a placeholder; attempting to access it results in undefined behavior.

```cpp
stl_const_iterator System::Collections::Generic::BaseDictionary<Map>::cend() const noexcept
```


### ReturnValue

An iterator pointing to the theoretical const-qualified element placed after the end element of collection.
