## Enumerator class


[Enumerator](./) that allows iterating through the dictionary. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../../../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../../../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument.

```cpp
class Enumerator : public System::Collections::Generic::SimpleEnumerator<map_t, KVPair>
```
