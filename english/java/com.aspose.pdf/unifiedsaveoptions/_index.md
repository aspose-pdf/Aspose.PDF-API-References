### UnifiedSaveOptions() {#UnifiedSaveOptions--}
```
public UnifiedSaveOptions()
```


### equals(Object arg0) {#equals-java.lang.Object-}
```
public boolean equals(Object arg0)
```




**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arg0 | java.lang.Object |  |

**Returns:**
boolean
### getClass() {#getClass--}
```
public final native Class<?> getClass()
```




**Returns:**
java.lang.Class<?>
### getProgressEventsRetranslator() {#getProgressEventsRetranslator--}
```
public ConversionProgressEventsTranslator getProgressEventsRetranslator()
```


Represents internal progress events processor that works during conversion and translates conversion events of internal conversion stages into external total progress events Also class broadcasts events that allow to free resources that not needed anymore This internal class handles events of PDF to APS and APS to [Other format] progress to calculate total progress and inform customer's code about that total progress events this class uses two types of events : ApsToExternal model conversion and events of conversion Pdf to APS to generate total progress events Export has three stage : 1) Pdf to Aps 2) Aps recognition 3\_ Aps export to target format Constructor allows tune how much pages are converted and what is approximmate part of this or that stage in total progress

**Returns:**
com.aspose.pdf.ConversionProgressEventsTranslator - ConversionProgressEventsTranslator instance
### getSaveFormat() {#getSaveFormat--}
```
public SaveFormat getSaveFormat()
```


Format of data save.

**Returns:**
[SaveFormat](../../com.aspose.pdf/saveformat) - SaveFormat value
### getWarningHandler() {#getWarningHandler--}
```
public WarningCallback getWarningHandler()
```


Callback to handle any warnings generated. The WarningHandler returns ReturnAction enum item specifying either Continue or Abort. Continue is the default action and the Save operation continues, however the user may also return Abort in which case the Save operation should cease.

**Returns:**
[WarningCallback](../../com.aspose.pdf/warningcallback) - IWarningCallback value
### hashCode() {#hashCode--}
```
public native int hashCode()
```




**Returns:**
int
### isCloseResponse() {#isCloseResponse--}
```
public boolean isCloseResponse()
```


Gets boolean value which indicates will Response object be closed after document saved into response.

**Returns:**
boolean - boolean value
### isExtractOcrSublayerOnly() {#isExtractOcrSublayerOnly--}
```
public boolean isExtractOcrSublayerOnly()
```


This attribute turned on functionality for extracting image or text for PDF documents with OCR sublayer.

Value:  true  text will be extracted in result document; otherwise,  false .

**Returns:**
boolean - boolean value
### isTryMergeAdjacentSameBackgroundImages() {#isTryMergeAdjacentSameBackgroundImages--}
```
public boolean isTryMergeAdjacentSameBackgroundImages()
```


Sometimes PDFs contain background images (of pages or table cells) constructed from several same tiling background images put one near other. In such case renderers of target formats (f.e MsWord for DOCS format) sometimes generates visible boundaries beetween parts of background images, cause their techniques of image edge smoothing (anti-aliasing) is different from Acrobat Reader. If it looks like exported document contains such visible boundaries between parts of same background images, please try use this setting to get rid of that unwanted effect. ATTENTION! This optimization of quality usually essentially slows down conversion, so, please, use this option only when it's really necessary.

**Returns:**
boolean - boolean value
### notify() {#notify--}
```
public final native void notify()
```




### notifyAll() {#notifyAll--}
```
public final native void notifyAll()
```




### setCloseResponse(boolean value) {#setCloseResponse-boolean-}
```
public void setCloseResponse(boolean value)
```


Sets boolean value which indicates will Response object be closed after document saved into response.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | boolean | boolean value |

### setExtractOcrSublayerOnly(boolean value) {#setExtractOcrSublayerOnly-boolean-}
```
public void setExtractOcrSublayerOnly(boolean value)
```


This attribute turned on functionality for extracting image or text for PDF documents with OCR sublayer.

Value:  true  text will be extracted in result document; otherwise,  false .

--------------------

Default value == false

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | boolean | boolean value |
