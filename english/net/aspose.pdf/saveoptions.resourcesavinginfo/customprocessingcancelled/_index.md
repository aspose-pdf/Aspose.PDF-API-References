## SaveOptions.ResourceSavingInfo.CustomProcessingCancelled field

this flag must set to "true" in custom code if for some reasons proposed file should be processed not with custom code but with converter's code itself in standard for converter way. So, it' setting set to true means that custom code did not process referenced file and converter must handle it itself (in both sences - for saving somewhere and for naming in referencing file).

```csharp
public bool CustomProcessingCancelled;
```
