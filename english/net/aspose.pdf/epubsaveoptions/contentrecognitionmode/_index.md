## EpubSaveOptions.ContentRecognitionMode field

When PDF file (that usually has fixed layout) is being converted, the conversion engine tries to perform grouping and multi-level analysis to restore the original document author's intent and produce result in flow layout. This property tunes that conversion for this or that desirable method of recognition of content.

```csharp
public RecognitionMode ContentRecognitionMode;
```
