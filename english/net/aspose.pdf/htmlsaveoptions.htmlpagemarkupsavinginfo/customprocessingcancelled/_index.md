## HtmlSaveOptions.HtmlPageMarkupSavingInfo.CustomProcessingCancelled field

Should be set in custom code when necessary. This flag must be set to "true" in custom code if for some reasons supplied html-markup should be processed not with custom code but with converter's code itself in standard for converter way. So, setting if this flag in custom code means that custom code did not process referenced file and converter must handle it itself

```csharp
public bool CustomProcessingCancelled;
```
