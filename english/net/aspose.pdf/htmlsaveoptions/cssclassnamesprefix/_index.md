## HtmlSaveOptions.CssClassNamesPrefix field

When PDFtoHTML converter generates result CSSs, CSS class names (something like ".stl_01 {}" ... ".stl_NN {}) are generated and used in result CSS. This property allows forcibly set class name prefix For example, if You want that all class names start with 'my_prefix_' (i.e. were something like 'my_prefix_1' ... 'my_prefix_NNN' ) , then just assign 'my_prefix_' to this property before conversion. If this property will stay untouched(i.e. null will be leaved as value ), then converter will generate class names itself (it wil be something like ".stl_01 {}" ... ".stl_NN {}")

```csharp
public string CssClassNamesPrefix;
```
