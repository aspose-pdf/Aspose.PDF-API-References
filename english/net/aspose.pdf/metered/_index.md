## Metered class

Provides methods to set metered key.

```csharp
public class Metered
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Metered](metered/)() | The default constructor. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetProductName](../../aspose.pdf/metered/getproductname/)() | Get the Product Name. |
| [SetMeteredKey](../../aspose.pdf/metered/setmeteredkey/)(string, string) | Sets metered public and private key. If you purchase metered license, when start application, this API should be called, normally, this is enough. However, if always fail to upload consumption data and exceed 24 hours, the license will be set to evaluation status, to avoid such case, you should regularly check the license status, if it is evaluation status, call this API again. |
| static [GetConsumptionCredit](../../aspose.pdf/metered/getconsumptioncredit/)() | Gets consumption credit. |
| static [GetConsumptionQuantity](../../aspose.pdf/metered/getconsumptionquantity/)() | Gets consumption file size. |
| static [IsMeteredLicensed](../../aspose.pdf/metered/ismeteredlicensed/)() | Check whether metered is licensed. |

## Examples

In this example, an attempt will be made to set metered public and private key.

```csharp
[C#]

var metered = new Metered();
metered.SetMeteredKey("PublicKey", "PrivateKey");
```

```csharp
[Visual Basic]

Dim metered As Metered = New Metered
metered.SetMeteredKey("PublicKey", "PrivateKey")
```

Shows how to activate a Metered license and track credit/consumption.

```csharp
[C#]

// Set metered public and private keys
var metered = new Aspose.Pdf.Metered();
metered.SetMeteredKey("PublicKey", "PrivateKey");
//Get current Consumption Credit and Quantity
var wasCredit = Metered.GetConsumptionCredit();
var wasQuantity = Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity();
//Operate using Aspose.Pdf
var doc = new Document();
doc.Pages.Add();
doc.Save(dataDir + "example.pdf");
//Little wait to be sure the transaction completed
System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10000);
//Get current Consumption Credit and Quantity
var nowCredit = Metered.GetConsumptionCredit();
var nowQuantity = Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity();
//Show Info
Console.WriteLine("Credit: was={0} now={1} difference={2}", wasCredit, nowCredit, nowCredit - wasCredit);
Console.WriteLine("Quantity: was={0} now={1} difference={2}", wasQuantity, nowQuantity, nowQuantity - wasQuantity);
```

```csharp
[Visual Basic]

' Set metered public And private keys
Dim metered = New Aspose.Pdf.Metered()
metered.SetMeteredKey("PublicKey", "PrivateKey")
'Get current Consumption Credit And Quantity
Dim wasCredit = Metered.GetConsumptionCredit()
Dim wasQuantity = Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity()
'Operate using Aspose.Pdf
Dim doc = New Document()
doc.Pages.Add()
doc.Save(dataDir + "example.pdf")
'Little wait to be sure the transaction completed
System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10000)
'Get current Consumption Credit And Quantity
Dim nowCredit = Metered.GetConsumptionCredit()
Dim nowQuantity = Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity()
'Show Info
Console.WriteLine("Credit: was={0} now={1} difference={2}", wasCredit, nowCredit, nowCredit - wasCredit)
Console.WriteLine("Quantity: was={0} now={1} difference={2}", wasQuantity, nowQuantity, nowQuantity - wasQuantity)
```
