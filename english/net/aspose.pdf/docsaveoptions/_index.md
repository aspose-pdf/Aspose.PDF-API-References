```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DocSaveOptions](docsaveoptions)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AddReturnToLineEnd](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/addreturntolineend) { get; set; } | Use paragraph or line breaks |
| [BatchSize](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/batchsize) { get; set; } | Defines batch size if batched conversion is applicable to source and destination formats pair. |
| [CloseResponse](../../aspose.pdf/saveoptions/closeresponse) { get; set; } | Gets or sets boolean value which indicates will Response object be closed after document saved into response. |
| [ExtractOcrSublayerOnly](../../aspose.pdf/unifiedsaveoptions/extractocrsublayeronly) { get; set; } | This atrribute turned on functionality for extracting image or text for PDF documents with OCR sublayer. |
| [Format](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/format) { get; set; } | Output format |
| [ImageResolutionX](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/imageresolutionx) { get; set; } | Converted images X resolution. |
| [ImageResolutionY](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/imageresolutiony) { get; set; } | Converted images Y resolution. |
| [MaxDistanceBetweenTextLines](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/maxdistancebetweentextlines) { get; set; } | This parameter is used for grouping text lines into paragraphs. Determines how far apart can be two relative text lines. Specified in hundreds of percent of the text lines height. |
| [MemorySaveModePath](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/memorysavemodepath) { get; set; } | Defines the path (file name or directory name) to hold temporary data when converting in memory save mode. |
| [Mode](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/mode) { get; set; } | Recognition mode. |
| [RecognizeBullets](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/recognizebullets) { get; set; } | Switch on the recognition of bullets |
| [RelativeHorizontalProximity](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/relativehorizontalproximity) { get; set; } | In Pdf words may be innerly represented with operators that prints words by independently printing their letters or syllables. So, to detect words sometimes we need detect groups of independent chars that are in fact words. This setting defines width of space between text elements(letters, syllables) that must be treated as distance between words during recognition of words in source PDF. (presence of empty space at least with this width between letters means that textual elements pertain to different words). It's normed to font size - 1.0 means 100% of supposed word's font size. ATTENTION!It's used only in cases when source PDF contains specific rarely used fonts for which optimal value cannot be calculated from font. So, in vast majority of cases this parameter changes nothing in result document. |
| [SaveFormat](../../aspose.pdf/saveoptions/saveformat) { get; } | Format of data save. |
| [WarningHandler](../../aspose.pdf/saveoptions/warninghandler) { get; set; } | Callback to handle any warnings generated. The WarningHandler returns ReturnAction enum item specifying either Continue or Abort. Continue is the default action and the Save operation continues, however the user may also return Abort in which case the Save operation should cease. |

## Fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CustomProgressHandler](../../aspose.pdf/docsaveoptions/customprogresshandler) | This handler can be used to handle conversion progress events f.e. it can be used to show progress bar or messages about current amount of processed pages, example of handler's code that shows progress on console is : |
| [TryMergeAdjacentSameBackgroundImages](../../aspose.pdf/unifiedsaveoptions/trymergeadjacentsamebackgroundimages) | Sometimes PDFs contain background images (of pages or table cells) constructed from several same tiling background images put one near other. In such case renderers of target formats (f.e MsWord for DOCS format) sometimes generates visible boundaries beetween parts of background images, cause their techniques of image edge smoothing (anti-aliasing) is different from Acrobat Reader. If it looks like exported document contains such visible boundaries between parts of same background images, please try use this setting to get rid of that unwanted effect. ATTENTION! This optimization of quality usually essentially slows down conversion, so, please, use this option only when it's really necessary. |
