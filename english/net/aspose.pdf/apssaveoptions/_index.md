## Fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [TryMergeAdjacentSameBackgroundImages](../../aspose.pdf/unifiedsaveoptions/trymergeadjacentsamebackgroundimages/) | Sometimes PDFs contain background images (of pages or table cells) constructed from several same tiling background images put one near other. In such case renderers of target formats (f.e MsWord for DOCS format) sometimes generates visible boundaries beetween parts of background images, cause their techniques of image edge smoothing (anti-aliasing) is different from Acrobat Reader. If it looks like exported document contains such visible boundaries between parts of same background images, please try use this setting to get rid of that unwanted effect. ATTENTION! This optimization of quality usually essentially slows down conversion, so, please, use this option only when it's really necessary. |

## Examples

The following example shows how to convert PDF file to APS file

```csharp
[C#]
	// The path to the documents directory.
	string dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";

	// The path to your PDF File.
	var pdfFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "PDF-to-APS.pdf");

	// The path to output APS File.
	var apsFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "PDF-to-APS.aps");
		
	using (Document pdfDocument = new Document(pdfFile))
	{
		// Initialize ApsSaveOptions  	
		ApsSaveOptions saveOptions = new ApsSaveOptions();
		
		// Save APS file
		pdfDocument.Save(apsFile, saveOptions);
	}
```

```csharp
[VB.NET]

    ' The path to the documents directory.
    Dim dataDir As String = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY"

    ' The path to your PDF File.
    Dim pdfFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "PDF-to-APS.pdf")

    ' The path to output APS File.
    Dim apsFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "PDF-to-APS.aps")
 
    Using pdfDocument As Document = New Document(pdfFile)

        ' Initialize ApsSaveOptions    
        Dim saveOptions As ApsSaveOptions = New ApsSaveOptions()
 
        ' Save APS file
        pdfDocument.Save(apsFile, saveOptions)
