## JpegDevice() {#constructor}

Initializes a new instance of the [`JpegDevice`](../../jpegdevice) class with default resolution and maximum quality.

```csharp
public JpegDevice()
```

### See Also

* class [JpegDevice](../../jpegdevice)
* namespace [Aspose.Pdf.Devices](../../jpegdevice)
* assembly [Aspose.PDF](../../../)

---

## JpegDevice(Resolution) {#constructor_1}

Initializes a new instance of the [`JpegDevice`](../../jpegdevice) class.  Resolution for the result image file, see [`Resolution`](../../resolution) class.

```csharp
public JpegDevice(Resolution resolution)
```

### See Also

* class [Resolution](../../resolution)
* class [JpegDevice](../../jpegdevice)
* namespace [Aspose.Pdf.Devices](../../jpegdevice)

## JpegDevice(int) {#constructor_6}

Initializes a new instance of the [`JpegDevice`](../../jpegdevice) class.

```csharp
public JpegDevice(int quality)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| quality | Int32 | Specifies the level of compression for an image. The range of useful values for the quality is from 0 to 100. The lower the number specified, the higher the compression and therefore the lower the quality of the image. Zero would give you the lowest quality image and 100 the highest. |

public JpegDevice(Resolution resolution, int quality)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| resolution | Resolution | Resolution for the result image file, see [`Resolution`](../../resolution) class. |
| quality | Int32 | Specifies the level of compression for an image. The range of useful values for the quality is from 0 to 100. The lower the number specified, the higher the compression and therefore the lower the quality of the image. Zero would give you the lowest quality image and 100 the highest. |
