## PdfAOptionsBase.OptimizeFileSize property

Gets or sets a value indicating whether to try to reduce the file size during the PDF/A conversion process.

```csharp
public bool OptimizeFileSize { get; set; }
```

### Property Value

`true` if the file size should be reduced as much as possible; otherwise, `false`.

## Remarks

When set to `true`, the conversion process will attempt to minimize the resulting file size. This might affect the conversion process performance.
