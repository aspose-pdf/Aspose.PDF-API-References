## TextState.BackgroundColor property

Sets background color of the text.

```csharp
public virtual Color BackgroundColor { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Note that the value is not preserved as a text characteristic within the document. The BackgroundColor property getter works for an object in case it was explicitly set previously with BackgroundColor setter for those object. The property is used by runtime in context of current generation/modification process.
