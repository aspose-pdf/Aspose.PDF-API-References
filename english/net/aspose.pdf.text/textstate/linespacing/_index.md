## TextState.LineSpacing property

Gets or sets line spacing of the text.

```csharp
public virtual float LineSpacing { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Note that the value is not preserved as a text characteristic within the document. The LineSpacing property getter works for an object in case it was explicitly set previously with LineSpacing setter for those object. The property is used by runtime in context of current generation/modification process.
