## TextReplaceOptions.FontSizeAdjustment enumeration

Specifies a policy for how the font size of text should be adjusted to fit within a containing area.

public enum FontSizeAdjustment
```

### Values

| None | `0` | The font size is not changed. |
| ShrinkToFit | `1` | The font size is reduced if the text is too large to fit the bounds. The font size is never increased if the text is smaller than the bounds. |
