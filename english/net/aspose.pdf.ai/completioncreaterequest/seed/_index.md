## CompletionCreateRequest.Seed property

Gets or sets the Seed value. This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

```csharp
public int? Seed { get; set; }
```
