## PageInformationAnnotation class

Represents a Page Information annotation in a PDF document. This annotation contains the file name, 
 page number, and the date and time of the annotation creation.

```csharp
public sealed class PageInformationAnnotation : PrinterMarkAnnotation
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PageInformationAnnotation](./pageinformationannotation/#constructor)(*[Page](../../aspose.pdf/page/), [Rectangle](../../aspose.pdf.drawing/rectangle/)*) | Initializes a new instance of the [`PageInformationAnnotation`](../../aspose.pdf.annotations/pageinformationannotation/) class on the given page in the given location. |
