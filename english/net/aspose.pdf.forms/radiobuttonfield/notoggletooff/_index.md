## RadioButtonField.NoToggleToOff property

Get or sets the flag that allows the radiobutton to have no selected value. If `true`, exactly one radio button shall be selected at all times; selecting the currently selected button has no effect. If `false`, clicking the selected button deselects it, leaving no button selected.

```csharp
public bool NoToggleToOff { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Some PDF readers (including Adobe Acrobat) may ignore the `false` state of the flag.
