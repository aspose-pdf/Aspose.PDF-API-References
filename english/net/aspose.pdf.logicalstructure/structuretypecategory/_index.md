## StructureTypeCategory class

Represents Categories of Standard Structure Types.

```csharp
public sealed class StructureTypeCategory
```

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.pdf.logicalstructure/structuretypecategory/tostring)() | Returns a string that represents the current object. |
| [explicit operator](../../aspose.pdf.logicalstructure/structuretypecategory/op_explicit) | Performs an explicit conversion from String to [`StructureTypeCategory`](../structuretypecategory). |

## Fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static readonly [BLSEs](../../aspose.pdf.logicalstructure/structuretypecategory/blses) | Block-level structure elements (BLSEs) describe the overall layout of content on the page, proceeding in the block-progression direction. |
| static readonly [GroupingElements](../../aspose.pdf.logicalstructure/structuretypecategory/groupingelements) | Grouping elements group other elements into sequences or hierarchies but hold no content directly and have no direct effect on layout. |
| static readonly [IllustrationElements](../../aspose.pdf.logicalstructure/structuretypecategory/illustrationelements) | Illustration elements are compact sequences of content, in page content order, that are considered to be unitary objects with respect to page layout. An illustration can be treated as either a BLSE or an ILSE. |
| static readonly [ILSEs](../../aspose.pdf.logicalstructure/structuretypecategory/ilses) | Inline-level structure elements (ILSEs) describe the layout of content within a BLSE, proceeding in the inline-progression direction. |
