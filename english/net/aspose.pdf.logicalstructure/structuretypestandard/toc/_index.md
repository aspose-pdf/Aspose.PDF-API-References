## StructureTypeStandard.TOC field

(Table of contents) A list made up of table of contents item entries (structure type TOCI) and/or other nested table of contents entries (TOC).

A TOC entry that includes only TOCI entries represents a flat hierarchy. A TOC entry that includes other nested TOC entries (and possibly TOCI entries) represents a more complex hierarchy.Ideally, the hierarchy of a top level TOC entry reflects the structure of the main body of the document.

```csharp
public static readonly StructureTypeStandard TOC;
```
