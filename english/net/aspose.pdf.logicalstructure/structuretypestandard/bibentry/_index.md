## StructureTypeStandard.BibEntry field

(Bibliography entry) A reference identifying the external source of some cited content. It may contain a label (structure type Lbl) as a child.

Although a bibliography entry is likely to include component parts identifying the cited content's author, work, publisher, and so forth, no standard structure types are defined at this level of detail.

```csharp
public static readonly StructureTypeStandard BibEntry;
```
