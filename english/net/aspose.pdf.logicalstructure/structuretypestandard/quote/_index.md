## StructureTypeStandard.Quote field

(Quotation) An inline portion of text attributed to someone other than the author of the surrounding text.

The quoted text should be contained inline within a single paragraph. This differs from the block-level element BlockQuote, which consists of one or more complete paragraphs (or other elements presented as if they were complete paragraphs).

```csharp
public static readonly StructureTypeStandard Quote;
```
